1
00:00:06,289 --> 00:00:10,430
Last lecture we investigated walking
using a pendulum-like template.

2
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,048
In this lecture we will learn about
templates used to describe the mechanics

3
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:14,676
of running.

4
00:00:14,676 --> 00:00:18,243
We will see why running is an important
mode of robotic locomotion,

5
00:00:18,243 --> 00:00:22,373
its advantages over walking, and that
biologists have shown that running can

6
00:00:22,373 --> 00:00:26,318
often be approximated by the dynamics
of the bouncing spring mass system,

7
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,880
much like hopping on a pogo stick.

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,710
Finally, we will show how running
templates can be anchored into

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,630
mechanics of robots so that they are able
to run robustly with minimal computation.

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,380
Why is running an important
mode of robotic locomotion?

11
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,830
If we can build robots that walk well,

12
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,840
why wouldn't we just design
robots to walk really fast?

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,360
Well, running is important because walking
becomes inefficient at high speeds.

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,130
Intuitively, we could see in the last
lecture that with our walking model,

15
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,600
that the energetic losses of impacts
when walking with a stiff leg

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,480
quickly increase with speed.

17
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,030
Instead of a stiff leg,

18
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,290
running involved using a relatively much
springier leg which reduces these impacts.

19
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,230
Another reason for running is that
there's a speed limitation for

20
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,820
walking with pendular-like dynamics.

21
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,500
During walking, gravity is the only force
accelerating the mass center downwards.

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,400
But the mass center follows a circular
trajectory during the pendulum

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,690
like motion, so

24
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,600
there is a centripetal acceleration
of the mass center towards the tail.

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,990
If this centripetal acceleration exceeds
the acceleration that gravity can provide,

26
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,920
then the normal force at the foot
against the ground will go to zero.

27
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,830
With your normal force, a leg isn't
able to generate forces on the body.

28
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:42,900
The centripetal acceleration divided
by the acceleration due to gravity

29
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,890
is equal to what is known
as Froude's number.

30
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,960
Simplifying to velocity squared divided
by the quantity of acceleration due to

31
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,360
gravity times the leg length.

32
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,710
Biologists predict that walking cannot
occur with a Froude number greater than 1.

33
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,091
Most animals, however,

34
00:01:58,091 --> 00:02:02,244
are observed transitioning from a walk
to a run well before a Froude number 1.

35
00:02:02,244 --> 00:02:05,479
For example, many bipeds,
including humans and birds,

36
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:09,572
are observed transitioning to a run
with a Froude number of about 0.5,

37
00:02:09,572 --> 00:02:14,530
with the hypothesis being that they do so
to choose the most energetically gait.

38
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,090
For these same reasons,
running is an important and

39
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:22,180
necessary form of locomotion for robots
that move with a higher Froude number.

40
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,720
Biologists have shown that the forces
generated against the ground while running

41
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,480
often appear to have the same force
profile as a hopping spring-mass system.

42
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,520
These observed forces have been measured
to be remarkably similar between animals

43
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,920
with widely different sizes,
leg numbers, postures, and morphologies.

44
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,940
Despite the very different ways
that animals generate these forces.

45
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,650
In this motion, the mass center height
decreases in the first half of the stance.

46
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,210
Reaches it's lowest point mid
stance as if compressing a spring.

47
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:55,050
And then increases in the second half
of the stance as if releasing a spring.

48
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,650
We refer to the spring mass
like dynamics of running

49
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,845
as the spring loaded pendulum model.

50
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:00,574
Where a leg or

51
00:03:00,574 --> 00:03:05,094
set of legs in contact with the ground can
be approximated by a single spring leg.

52
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:09,075
There are many variations of
a spring-loaded pendulum mechanism,

53
00:03:09,075 --> 00:03:13,341
some of which have proved to be very
useful as templates for roboticists.

54
00:03:13,341 --> 00:03:17,620
This theme of modeling leg of locomotion
as a pendulum continues with running.

55
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,180
Because during each stance, the center of
mass is interacting with the ground for

56
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,490
a leg much like the mass on a pendulum
acts through its base through a link.

57
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:30,490
However, unlike walking, we have
the added leg compliance in the form

58
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:34,380
of a spring to store and
release energy from stride to stride.

59
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,850
This spring is important because
like in elastic bouncing ball,

60
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,620
many running organisms in robots
store potential energy during stance,

61
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,690
to improve the energetic
efficiency of their gait.

62
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,980
For example, using tendons or
tendon-like mechanisms.

63
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,510
Animals appear to run in the spring loaded
pendulum dynamics in many directions,

64
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,460
not just forwards and backwards.

65
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,050
As we live in three dimensional space,

66
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:59,380
there are three planes of motion
available to move through.

67
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,950
These planes have anatomical
names relative to

68
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,140
the center of the organism or robot.

69
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,000
The Sagittal plane divides an organism
into left and right halves.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,920
The Coronal plane divides an organism
into front and rear halves.

71
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,150
And the Transverse plane divides
an organism into top and bottom halves.

72
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,750
Locomotion can occur in all three planes,
but often it is useful to examine or

73
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,580
approximate motion in a single plane.

74
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,430
The Sagittal plane is probably
what we are most familiar with,

75
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,830
as many animals run predominantly
in a Sagittal plane.

76
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,200
However, running also
occurs in also planes.

77
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,710
Crabs are notable Coronal plane runners,
and

78
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,150
many organisms such as cockroaches run
primarily in the Transverse plane.

79
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,880
For the rest of the lecture we'll focus
on two templates that are variants

80
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,950
of the spring loaded pendulum.

81
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,860
The spring loaded inverted pendulum, or

82
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,930
slip model includes the presence of
ballistic flight between stance events and

83
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,860
is commonly used to describe Sagittal and
Coronal plane running.

84
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,300
The lateral leg spring or

85
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,380
LLS model involves switching between
alternating sides of leg ground contact.

86
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,050
The LLS model is commonly used to
describe transverse plane running.

87
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,900
The Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum or
SLIP template is given by a point mass

88
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,400
attached to the ground by a masses
spring leg in the presence of gravity.

89
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,790
Often in biology, SLIP running can be
seen in the Sagittal and Coronal planes.

90
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:24,200
During stance, SLIP generates the familiar
spring-loaded pendulum forces

91
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,330
seen in biological running.

92
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,540
When stance is complete,
the system lifts off the ground and

93
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,500
it undergoes ballistic flight.

94
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,310
The leg angle is changed in flight to
prepare for the next touchdown event.

95
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:39,290
And when that spring leg touches down
again the process repeats itself.

96
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,470
There are many variances
to this SLIP template.

97
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,450
Different spring models can be used,
for example a linear hook slide spring.

98
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:49,700
Friction can be neglected or
taken into account as well as actuation.

99
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,290
Typically SLIP is controlled by
either choosing the appropriate

100
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,990
legging on flight, or by formulating

101
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,000
actuated version of the model to
apply forces of torques and stance.

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,220
Although we have it shown here for

103
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,480
simplicity, SLIP often takes into account
the pitch angle of the mass center.

104
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,350
The SLIP template is much more complex
than the rimless wheel template for

105
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,970
a few reasons.

106
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,610
One is that is there are more
degrees of freedom even when

107
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,030
pitch isn’t taken into account.

108
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,430
In stance and flight the mass is free
to move in two directions instead of

109
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,350
one as with the rimless wheel.

110
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,140
Another is that
the equations of motion for

111
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,330
SLIP take the form of
a hybrid dynamical system.

112
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,030
There are two hybrid states,
stance and flight.

113
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,310
Each with it's own equations of
motion governing the dynamics.

114
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,080
The transition from stance to
flight occurs when the leg

115
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,315
reaches it's rest length with
a positive radial velocity.

116
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:40,620
Although transition from flight to stance
occurs when the leg contacts the ground.

117
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,450
Physically accurate hybrid dynamical
systems can be very complex, and

118
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:49,710
typically are much more difficult to
analyze than non-hybrid dynamical systems.

119
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:53,390
But despite their complexity,
hybrid systems offer a natural choice for

120
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:57,680
modelling leg of locomotion, due to the
changing dynamics depending on if a leg is

121
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,480
in contact with the ground or not.

122
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,104
Unfortunately, no analytic
solution existS for

123
00:07:02,104 --> 00:07:05,510
the equations in motion
describing dynamics of SLIP.

124
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,950
So, it's not possible to
get a close form expression

125
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:12,740
describing the position of the mass
center as a function of time.

126
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,390
This is because the class
of differential equations,

127
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,875
which can be solved analytically,
is very small.

128
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:22,436
And no such solution exists for
the stance dynamics here.

129
00:07:22,436 --> 00:07:25,585
We can, however,
perform numerical analysis of SLIP and

130
00:07:25,585 --> 00:07:30,088
apply mathematical tools to qualitatively
describe the behavior of this system,

131
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:32,680
which can be quite insightful.

132
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,210
If we as roboticists need analytic
solutions governing the equations of

133
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:41,030
motion, often we can make approximations
to the system to achieve our goals.

134
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:45,506
Several techniques, such as making
small angle approximations to linearize

135
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:50,185
the sines and cosines, assuming that
gravity acts radially instead of downwards

136
00:07:50,185 --> 00:07:53,507
in stance, or
outright ignoring gravity during stance,

137
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:57,938
can be used to get closed form expressions
of the state from stride to stride.

138
00:07:57,938 --> 00:08:00,607
Interestingly even though we are,
in effect,

139
00:08:00,607 --> 00:08:03,343
making an approximation
to win approximation,

140
00:08:03,343 --> 00:08:07,940
this can work quiet well and practice
use for controlling robots to run.

141
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,920
As long as the state stays
within the operating regime or

142
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,130
this assumption are approximately valid.

143
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:18,490
The body and legs of the Rex Robot in
many ways embodied the slip template.

144
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,800
Rex has six C shaped springy legs that can

145
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,520
interact with the ground in unison to
make the center of mass trajectory

146
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,760
look like it's under the influence
of a single spring leg.

147
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,340
By using three legs at once in
an alternating tripod gait,

148
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,900
Rex is able to run with SLIP like
dynamics in the Sagittal plane

149
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,270
while passably being very balanced.

150
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:44,350
Due to the tripod of support preventing it
from falling over In any one direction,

151
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,560
much like a three-legged chair.

152
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,930
In this video, the computer on
Rex isn't using any sensors,

153
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,350
aside from the motor encoders, to run.

154
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:57,060
It's just spinning the motors and letting
the natural slip-like dynamics occur.

155
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,910
Here the naturally stable dynamics of
the robot body directly interact with

156
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,760
the environment,

157
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,090
minimizing the computation
needed at the onboard computer.

158
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:09,260
Might even say that the computation has
been offloaded to the mechanical design to

159
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,410
act like an analog computer.

160
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,620
This is important, because it makes
the behavior of Rex not dependent on

161
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,420
sensors measuring
the external environment, or

162
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,260
some programmed internal
model of the world.

163
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,030
Rex can run with the stable gait using
minimal computation just by anchoring

164
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,150
the SLIP template.

165
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:30,450
Another important template is called
the Lateral Leg Spring or LLS model, and

166
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,560
is often used to model
running in a transfers plane.

167
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,815
In this template the dynamics are governed
by the familiar spring loaded pendulum.

168
00:09:37,815 --> 00:09:41,730
However, once the leg on one side of the
body lifts off, a leg in the other side of

169
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,620
the body touches down at the same
instant generating side to side motion.

170
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,710
Like the SLIP,
many different variants of LLS exists.

171
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,800
For example, the heading angle
of the body can be included and

172
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,050
the legs can connect to the body at
points offset from the center of mass.

173
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,740
It turns out that the side
to side motion generated by

174
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,850
LLS can be very stable
with the right parameters.

175
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,820
It is hypothesized that this
mechanical stability could

176
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,350
explain the stability
of cockroaches running.

177
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,150
Where cockroaches are able
to react to environmental

178
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:14,270
perturbations faster then
would be possible for

179
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:18,990
a neurological signal to go from the leg
to the brain, be processed, and go back.

180
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,100
Instead, it is thought that the control
system is partially built-in

181
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,960
to the mechanism in the cockroach,

182
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,590
much like how his template can
be anchored into a robot design.

183
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:30,080
The DynaClimber Robot is
a robotic climber that runs

184
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,850
vertically with LLS-like dynamics.

185
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,830
Like Rex, the DynaClimber's mechanical
design provides stability for

186
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:41,840
its motion, allowing it to run up a wall
with little sensing or computation.

187
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,440
Today we've seen that
the mechanics of running can

188
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,530
often be captured by the mechanism
of a spring-loaded pendulum which

189
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:53,630
generates the same ground reaction profile
as created by many biological runners.

190
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,530
Running is an important
mode of locomotion for

191
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:59,250
legged robots, because it is more
efficient than walking at high speeds.

192
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,090
And because walking like
a pendulum with a stiff leg

193
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,250
can't occur at a Froude
number of greater than one.

194
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,180
We've seen that running can
occur in different directions,

195
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,520
not simply the Sagittal plane.

196
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,420
Most importantly,

197
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,410
the dynamics of running templates can be
anchored into legged robots, allowing them

198
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:19,010
to run in a variety of directions with
little to no computation or sensing.

199
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,650
Using their natural dynamics instead for
stability and to passively balance.

200
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:27,437
Next lecture, we will finish our section
on templates by examining the class

201
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:31,352
of running robots that use the underlying
dynamics of SLIP to actively balance.
