1
00:00:06,204 --> 00:00:10,340
Hello, today we will be talking
about dynamically walking robots.

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,645
We'll go over what is walking,
why is it useful for legged robots.

3
00:00:14,645 --> 00:00:18,635
And introduce a simple walking
model called the rimless wheel.

4
00:00:18,635 --> 00:00:21,845
This rimless wheel is a special
type of model called a template.

5
00:00:21,845 --> 00:00:24,955
Templates are a special class
of models that represent

6
00:00:24,955 --> 00:00:29,145
the simplest models that are needed
to describe a target behavior.

7
00:00:29,145 --> 00:00:34,080
We'll show that templates can give design
insights into building legged robots, and

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,730
then by building the rimless wheel
template into our walking motion of

9
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,660
the mechanical system we can get a robot
to walk robustly with minimal computation.

10
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,650
So before we get into walking
let's take a step back and

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,040
talk about locomotion in general.

12
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,910
Robots and animals move through
their environments by generating

13
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,780
forces on their environments.

14
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,670
For example, when you run,
your leg pushes downwards and

15
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,540
backwards, creating a downwards and
backwards force on the environment.

16
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,000
Through Newton's Third Law, a reaction
force is created upwards and forwards.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,221
Newton's Second Law then causes
an acceleration which gives you movement.

18
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:15,761
Biologists studying legged locomotion have
shown that the methods animals use to

19
00:01:15,761 --> 00:01:19,930
generate forces on their
environment are extremely diverse.

20
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,947
For example, the number of legs, and

21
00:01:21,947 --> 00:01:25,710
the shapes of legs of
the animals varies tremendously.

22
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,000
Humans have two legs, whereas millipedes,
have approximately 200.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,610
Hedgehogs have relatively short legs,
while spiders have very long,

24
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,250
and thin legs.

25
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,790
But, biologists have also discovered
that the actual forces generated

26
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,300
by these diverse strategies
are remarkably similar.

27
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,000
For example, when ground reaction
forces are measured in running

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,360
they generally follow
the same basic force profile.

29
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,090
A human running on two legs and
a dog trotting on four legs

30
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,860
can look very similar based on the ground
reaction forces they generate.

31
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,600
They're even similar to cockroaches
running with an alternating tripod gate

32
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,040
with six legs.

33
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,870
And even crabs running
sideways with eight legs.

34
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,370
So biologists have proposed two basic
mechanisms to describe these four

35
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,248
profiles generated during walking and
running.

36
00:02:13,248 --> 00:02:16,550
The forces generating during
walking tend to appear

37
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,070
as a mass vaulting over
a relatively stiff leg.

38
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:24,620
Forces generated during running tend to
look like a mass bouncing on a spring

39
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,530
much like a pogo stick.

40
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,750
These mechanisms have important features
that are relevant for robot design.

41
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,120
For example, both mechanisms involve
some way of retaining a portion

42
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,880
of the mechanical energy of the previous
stride to use in the next stride.

43
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,870
Also by analyzing simple
models of these mechanisms,

44
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,210
we can make statements
about their stability.

45
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:49,110
So let's take a closer look at walking,
which is the focus of this lecture.

46
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,020
We can gain insight into the mechanism

47
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,370
behind walking by looking
into its energetics.

48
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,970
So a distinctive feature of walking is
the kinetic energy, which is the energy of

49
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,420
motion, oscillates out a phase with
gravitational potential energy.

50
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,059
Which is the energy due to gravity.

51
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,630
When a leg touches down and

52
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,800
a body moves forwards in the beginning
of a walking stance, the body uses it's

53
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,640
kinetic energy to vault upwards and
over the leg in the first half of stance.

54
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,710
This process converts some kinetic energy
into gravitational potential running

55
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,730
energy during the second half of stance.

56
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:31,000
Starting when the leg is vertical,
this gravitational potential

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,800
energy is converted back into kinetic
energy as the body is pulled forwards and

58
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,070
downwards by gravity,
accelerating the body.

59
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,780
This process repeats itself
when the next leg touches down.

60
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,960
This process of exchanging kinetic and

61
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:50,420
gravitational potential energy can be
very efficient especially at low speeds.

62
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,000
Animals have been measured
to conserve up to 70% of

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,430
their mechanical energy while walking.

64
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,410
Energy efficiency is important for
legged robots because it allows us to

65
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,820
build robots that potentially move faster,
operate for

66
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,060
longer durations, and don't have to
carry as much fuel or battery weight.

67
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,030
The type of walking we have been talking
about so far is called dynamic walking.

68
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,920
Where the robot is not perfectly
balanced during stance.

69
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,480
As you may have seen in videos,

70
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,870
many robots also walk by a different
mechanism called quasi-static walking.

71
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,850
In quasi-static walking,
the robot is nearly balanced

72
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,640
throughout its entire walking stride,
and undergoes minimal accelerations.

73
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,150
Because accelerations are minimal
in quasi-static walking,

74
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,852
it is typically quite slow.

75
00:04:33,852 --> 00:04:37,370
Although quasi-static motions
in general have there use,

76
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,370
we will focus only on dynamic
motions in this lecture and

77
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:45,170
course due to their potential to make
robots faster and more efficient.

78
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:49,660
Now that we have identified a mechanism
of locomotion, how do we model it?

79
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,400
There are many ways to model locomotion,

80
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,770
from simulations involving thousands of
variables to ones that are quite simple.

81
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,770
Overly complex models can fall victim
to what is called Bellman's curse of

82
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,615
dimensionality, where the amount of
computation time or data points needed for

83
00:05:04,615 --> 00:05:08,625
analysis, increases exponentially
with the number of variables.

84
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,765
On the other hand,
extremely simple models can be too limited

85
00:05:11,765 --> 00:05:15,410
to capture the full complexity
of the desired behavior.

86
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,460
To address this tension between simplicity
and complexity, roboticists and

87
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,790
biologists have developed a modeling
framework called templates and

88
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:27,960
anchors to capture both the simplicity of
the underlying mechanism of locomotion and

89
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,100
its complexity in a physical system.

90
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,470
Templates are the simplest model needed
to describe the target behavior.

91
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,280
For example, with running and walking
templates could be models representing

92
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,050
the underlying mechanisms
observed in biology.

93
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,870
Because they have no more states or
parameters than necessary, templates can

94
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,210
capture what is fundamentally going on
in a movement in it's most simple form.

95
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:54,580
This simplicity makes templates very
beneficial for analysis and control.

96
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,610
Anchors, on the other hand,
are more elaborate models than incorporate

97
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,050
the important degrees of
freedom of a physical system.

98
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,680
For example,
when modeling a hopping kangaroo,

99
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,670
an anchor might take into
account the leg joints.

100
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:10,460
The template then describes the motion
of the kangaroo through the anchor.

101
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,320
By trimming away the degrees of freedom,
a template

102
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,190
might consist of a simple bouncing mass
on a spring to describe the kangaroo.

103
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,570
This relationship between templates and
anchors is very important.

104
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,070
A template is only valid
if it in some sense

105
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:27,060
is a version of the anchor
with fewer degrees of freedom.

106
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,520
In which case, we say that the anchor
embeds the template dynamics.

107
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,540
And then if the template is anchored to
the physical system through the anchoring.

108
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,497
This relationship can also facilitate the
control of robots as control policies at

109
00:06:39,497 --> 00:06:44,046
the simple template level can then be
mapped in a more complex anchor level.

110
00:06:44,046 --> 00:06:48,755
For example, the control of the template
can be used to guide the control of

111
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:50,920
the individual robot joints.

112
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,840
To illustrate how useful templates
can be for low level robot control,

113
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,020
we're going to look at a model
that we consider a template for

114
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,390
walking called the rimless wheel.

115
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,560
The rimless wheel has historical
significance as it was

116
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,060
one of the models Tad McGeer, then
a professor at Simon Treasure University,

117
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,660
used in analyzing his walkers
powered entirely by gravity,

118
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,000
in his famous 1990 paper titled
Passive Dynamic Walking.

119
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,540
The rimless wheel is a relatively
simple dynamical system,

120
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,090
representing a spoked wheel
with its rim removed.

121
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:27,130
This template also incorporates
an important aspect of legged locomotion,

122
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,540
a power source.

123
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:33,500
Gravity pulls the rimless wheel down
an incline ramp, accelerating the model

124
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,810
over the course of a stride and
allowing it to walk on its spokes.

125
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,390
The fact that gravity is the power
source instead of electricity

126
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,180
isn't that important as we will see that
a small amount of constant work done by

127
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,410
gravity each stride can be replaced by
motors to generate powered robot walking.

128
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,660
It might not be immediately obvious,
however,

129
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,120
most wheels capture walking behavior.

130
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,880
A rimless wheel walking down a ramp is
a lot like a wheel rolling down a ramp,

131
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,180
much like you probably studied
in your first physics course.

132
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,160
In a rolling motion with a normal wheel,

133
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,720
gravity is accelerating the center of
mass downwards, causing a movement

134
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,650
around whatever point the wheel is
currently touching the ground with.

135
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,090
This moment around the ground contact
point accelerates the wheel down the ramp.

136
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:21,690
This ground contact points on
the wheel touch the ground only for

137
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,950
an instant before lifting off again.

138
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,350
So what happens when we
give the wheel spokes and

139
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,530
then take away the rim of the wheel?

140
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,040
Well, if there's an internet or

141
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,800
very large number of spokes
then almost nothing changes.

142
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,150
We get rolling behavior or
something very similar to it.

143
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,550
But as we take away the number of spokes,
the center of mass has a more pronounced

144
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:46,860
vault over the point where the spoke
contacts the ground, and the kinetic and

145
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,410
gravitational potential energy oscillate
out of phase with greater amplitude.

146
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,040
We've arrived at a very
simple model of walking.

147
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,310
In our model,
the spoken contact with the ground

148
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,210
represents the leg in
contact with the ground.

149
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,810
As one leg lifts off,
another instantaneously touches down so

150
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:09,480
that the body represented by the center of
mass always has a leg in ground contact.

151
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,820
Of course, a rimless wheel doesn't
look entirely like a biped.

152
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,449
Maybe it reminds you more of a tumbleweed.

153
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:21,070
But if we choose to visually ignore the
spokes not in contact with the ground, and

154
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,230
instead pretend that there's another
leg recirculating to prepare for

155
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,040
the next step, we have a convincing
picture of how this model

156
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,600
can represent a biped walking
with what we call a compass gait.

157
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,410
The version of the rimless wheel,
that we are discussing today,

158
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,280
only has one degree of freedom,
which is the wheel angle.

159
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,550
And six parameters which are the mass,

160
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:44,310
how far the mass is distributed from the
mass center, the leg length, the inter-leg

161
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:49,650
angle, the ramp angle, and finally,
the vertical acceleration due to gravity.

162
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:54,410
The rimless wheel template is a simple
enough model to analyze mathematically.

163
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,120
But we will forego
the mathematical analysis, and

164
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,500
instead rely on physical intuition
with a 3D printed wheel model.

165
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,750
So what does it take for
our rimless wheel model to walk?

166
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,240
Over a level ground,
in the absence of a source of energy,

167
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,970
the model quickly comes to a stop due
to the legs impacting the ground.

168
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:16,030
Because the leg impacts involve
mass coming sharply to a stop,

169
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,010
which results in a loss of kinetic energy.

170
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,320
This, of course, is in contrast
to a wheel rolling down a ramp

171
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,750
which can accelerate for quite some time
before being slowed down by friction.

172
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,930
This illustrates an important concept
in legged locomotion which is that

173
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:34,660
legged locomotion is fundamentally and
energetically a dissipative process.

174
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,860
As you can see, it only takes a small
amount of gravitational potential energy,

175
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,140
provided by a slight ramp incline, for
the model to walk at a steady speed.

176
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,390
From stride to stride, the mass center
of the rimless wheel gets lower and

177
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,550
lower as it travels down the ramp.

178
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,200
This change in height is constant for
each stride.

179
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,130
So, during each stride approximately
the same amount of gravitational potential

180
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:01,530
energy is being added to the model
which is converted into kinetic energy.

181
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:05,480
This kinetic energy is then lost
when the leg impacts the ground.

182
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,840
This process then repeats giving us
the repetitive behavior that we see.

183
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,780
If we tilt the ramp up more, more energy
is added and the template walks faster.

184
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:19,800
If we lower the ramp less energy is added
for stride and the template walks slower.

185
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,800
The fact that the model walks with such
a small ramp angle, just that walking like

186
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,380
a rimless wheel is quite energetically
efficient despite the losses involve.

187
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,370
And in a minute, we will see that using
a modern of gravity to add the small

188
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:37,740
amount of fix energy per stride on
a robot retains this efficiency property.

189
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,800
Aside from the efficiency of the motion,

190
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,660
there is another important
feature at play here.

191
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:47,830
There is actually an advantage to legged
locomotion being a lossy process, and

192
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,470
that is because it allows legged
locomotion to be mechanically stable.

193
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:54,680
Notice, that if we roll
a wheel down the ramp,

194
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,430
the speed of the wheel
increases as it rolls.

195
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,590
But not so with our legged template.

196
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,570
This is because the energetic
losses naturally regulate

197
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,290
the speed of the system.

198
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,650
Odic will go into more detail about
this during his anchor lectures.

199
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:12,070
But the intuitive idea here is that
the energetic losses from the leg impacts

200
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:16,230
increases with velocity, which slows down
the template if it gets moving too fast.

201
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:22,330
However, if the template is to slow
these impact losses are small and

202
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:27,430
the constant amount of energy added per
stride by gravity speeds the system up.

203
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:31,810
Eventually the system reaches a periodic
limit cycle, a steady rolling speed.

204
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,070
Stability is an incredibly important
topic in leg and robots, and

205
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,920
we will continue to come back
to it during this course.

206
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,310
So why is it important that our
walking template is stable?

207
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:45,320
One reason is that if we build robots
that passively anchored a template

208
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,500
through their mechanical design,

209
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:53,050
it allows us to build robots that walk
stably with little to no computation.

210
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,190
This is Tad McGuire's famous
passive dynamic walker.

211
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:01,340
The robot is purely mechanical, it has
no computer, no motors, and no sensors.

212
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,650
And yet, it can walk down a ramp in a
manner that is shockingly anthropomorphic.

213
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:10,200
Instead of being programmed on a computer,
the control scheme is designed into

214
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,930
the mechanism, in much the same way
as it is with the rimless wheel.

215
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:18,530
Because the underlying template
behavior is stable and

216
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:22,190
has been mechanically encoded or
anchored in the machine.

217
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:25,970
It is able to walk a non-trivial
duration without falling over

218
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,300
at a nearly constant speed, despite the
model being an imperfect representation

219
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,150
of the physical world, as all models are.

220
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,290
As we have said before, a robot can walk

221
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:40,900
like a rimless wheel using only a small
amount of motor energy instead of gravity.

222
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,130
Andy Marina,
a professor at Cornell University,

223
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,870
did just that with his robot
called the Cornell ranger.

224
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:53,086
In 2011, the Cornell ranger was able
to walk an ultra marathon of 40.5

225
00:13:53,086 --> 00:13:57,560
miles non-stop on a single battery
charge of less than 500 watt hours,

226
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,300
or about $0.05 worth of electricity.

227
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,990
By creating a robot that is close to
a literal instantiation of an efficient

228
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:10,210
locomotion model, Angie Rerina was
able to more than double the previous

229
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:14,810
distant record for robotic legged
locomotion on a single battery charge.

230
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,710
Robots can also mechanically
encode templates without literally

231
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,670
instantiating them.

232
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,350
For example, the REX robot walks with
a motorized alternating tripod gait

233
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:26,190
that has rimless wheel dynamics in the
forward direction, while the tripod and

234
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:29,720
support allows the robot to be very
balanced in the other directions,

235
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,050
much like a three-legged chair.

236
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,420
This stability of both the template and

237
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:39,060
the anchor allows Rex to walk robustly
over a wide variety of terrains,

238
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,820
even rocky slopes and mountains, with
almost no control at the computer level.

239
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,380
Instead, the robot interacts with, and
responds to changes in the environment at

240
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:51,700
the mechanical level, which is possible,
because the primary dynamical effects can

241
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,600
be modeled as a mechanically
stable template.

242
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,460
In this lecture,

243
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,620
we discussed what biologists have found
to be a mechanism behind dynamic walking.

244
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,600
That walking can be approximated
by the pendular dynamics

245
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,250
of a mass vaulting over
its relatively stiff leg.

246
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,520
We've formulated a low
degree of freedom model for

247
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,030
this mechanism, called the rimless wheel.

248
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,900
This model is simple enough to analyze and
provide insight,

249
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:19,095
yet complex enough to capture general
principles including efficiency and

250
00:15:19,095 --> 00:15:22,230
self-stabilizing behavior in
the presence of a power source.

251
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,580
And we saw that by embedding the template
dynamics into a physical robot,

252
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,790
engineers can build machines
that can walk without computers,

253
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:34,220
as well as make robot marathoners and
mountain climbers.

254
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,732
Next lecture we'll focus on templates for
running and

255
00:15:36,732 --> 00:15:40,182
we'll see that running can be described
using pendular dynamics as well.

256
00:15:40,182 --> 00:15:43,479
When the relatively stiff leg
is replaced with a spring leg.
