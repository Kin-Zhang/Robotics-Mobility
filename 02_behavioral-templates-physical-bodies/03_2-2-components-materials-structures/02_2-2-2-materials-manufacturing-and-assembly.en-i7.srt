00:00:06,784 --> 00:00:10,750
In this section we aim to qualify
the failure mode of materials,

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:15,170
as well as understanding how to
shape them into desired parts.

3
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:19,900
There are two main material types,
brittle materials and ductile materials.

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,190
In this video we see acrylic plastic,
a brittle material.

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,790
The sample is being bent more and
more, until it fails catastrophically.

6
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,580
In this video we see a ductile material,

7
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,740
aluminum, that is being
bent in a similar way.

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,290
The aluminum bends, and

9
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,980
it can deform permanently, known as
plastic deformation, before it breaks.

10
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,340
The materials in this section are all
isotropic, meaning that they respond

11
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,940
the same way to stimulus that
comes in different directions.

12
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,930
Now we will learn about
a stress strain curve.

13
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,510
Stress, as we learned in the previous
section, is force normalized by area.

14
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,750
Stress is typically referred
to by the Greek letter sigma.

15
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,590
Strain is displacement normalized
by nominal length of the material.

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,570
Strain is normally referred to
by the Greek letter epsilon.

17
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,670
In this figure we see
a stress strain curve for

18
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,410
a brittle material,
such as acrylic in the previous video.

19
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:21,750
The slope of this line, denoted e, is
the Young's modulus, or elastic modulus.

20
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,395
In this figure we see the stress
strain curve for a ductile material.

21
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:30,500
Once again, as in the brittle material,
there's a linear region,

22
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,770
up to point 1, which is the yield
strength of the material.

23
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,190
If the yield strength is exceeded,
we start to see plastic or

24
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,680
permanent deformation of the material.

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,610
As the stress increases,
we now see nonlinear deformation,

26
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,230
up to point 3, which is the ultimate
strength of the material.

27
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:52,220
If this ultimate strength is exceeded,
the material will break.

28
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:57,580
If the material experiences a sustained
stress between the yield strength and

29
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:04,930
the ultimate strength as seen in point 1*,
permanent plastic deformation will occur.

30
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:10,640
When the material is unloaded, the strain
will decrease with slope e again.

31
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,210
This material has now
deformed plastically.

32
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,410
Now when the material is loaded again,

33
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:20,380
the nonlinear region will only only
start at stresses exceeding 1*.

34
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,900
This is known as strain hardening.

35
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,680
Now that we understand how
some materials respond,

36
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,940
how do we make them into
the desired part shape?

37
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,130
First we consider more conventional
subtractive manufacturing.

38
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,460
Subtractive manufacturing
is like sculpting.

39
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,720
You start with a large block of material
and cut away what is not desired.

40
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,594
In this video we see a computer-controlled
milling machine cutting out a guitar

41
00:02:46,594 --> 00:02:49,328
from a large block of
multiple kinds of wood.

42
00:02:52,823 --> 00:02:56,953
In this video we see a laser cutter
burning through some ABS plastic and

43
00:02:56,953 --> 00:02:59,823
cutting out a desired
two-dimensional shape.

44
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:07,506
Typically, subtractive manufacturing is
also joined by an assembly step in which

45
00:03:07,506 --> 00:03:11,500
many smaller parts are combined
together using fasteners.

46
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,718
More recently we have seen a rise
in additive manufacturing,

47
00:03:14,718 --> 00:03:17,780
notably 3D printing.

48
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,630
Additive manufacturing necessarily
has a smaller material palette,

49
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,720
as it relies on the properties of
the materials themselves to form the part.

50
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,510
In this video we see a stereo lithographic
3D printer, which uses a UV-curable resin.

51
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,960
The resin is selectively cured in
layers onto a moveable platform, and

52
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,520
is pulled out of the bath.

53
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,816
In this video we see a 3D printer that
relies on fuse deposition manufacturing.

54
00:03:42,816 --> 00:03:46,776
Here a polymer is heated past its
glass-transition temperature and

55
00:03:46,776 --> 00:03:50,240
is deposited layer by layer
onto the build plate.

56
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,720
One significant advantage of 3D printing
is that complexity is almost free.

57
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,720
Typically, the time and

58
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,300
cost of the print is only proportional
to the volume of material used.

59
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,810
Sometimes sacrificial
support material is needed

60
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,440
when the part has significant overhangs,
as can be seen in this image.

61
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,450
In the construction of our
robots we typically prefer

62
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,660
2D manufacturing processes
that are cheap and

63
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,216
readily available that can then
be combined into 3D machines.

64
00:04:21,216 --> 00:04:26,091
In this figure we see the Minitaur and
Jerboa robots that were predominately

65
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:31,206
manufactured using 2D techniques and
then assembled into full 3D machines.

66
00:04:31,206 --> 00:04:34,975
I would now like to highlight three
techniques that are used to facilitate

67
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,600
this assembly.

68
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,120
These are finger joints,
square nuts, and standoffs.

69
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,490
In this image we see two
water jet aluminum plates

70
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,690
that are perpendicularly connected.

71
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,960
Finger joints are used so that there
is significant overlapping material

72
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,750
to prevent any failure
due to shear stress.

73
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:58,129
Captive square nuts are used to
facilitate the manufacturing process so

74
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:00,002
that no tapping has to be done.

75
00:05:00,002 --> 00:05:02,048
A cut out is simply made the right size so

76
00:05:02,048 --> 00:05:04,940
that a square nut can be
pressed into the part.

77
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,940
In this image we see a standoff being
used to provide two parallel planes.

78
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,140
Standoffs can be threaded or
unthreaded and

79
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,800
greatly speed up assembly time as it
prevents manual tapping once again.
