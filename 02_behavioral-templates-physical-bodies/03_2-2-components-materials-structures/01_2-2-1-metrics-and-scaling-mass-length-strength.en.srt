00:00:07,766 --> 00:00:12,280
In this section, we consider
the implications on strength, mass, and

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,100
other properties when changing lens scale.

3
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,530
Here we see two similar triangles.

4
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,800
They are similar because the angles a,
b, and c are all equal.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,570
However, one triangle has side length
L and the other has side length 2L.

6
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,450
Now we consider the implications on
some properties of these triangles.

7
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,150
Since the perimeter is
simply the sum of the sides,

8
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:41,250
the perimeter of the larger triangle will
be double that of the small triangle.

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,640
So the perimeter will scale
linearly with the lens.

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,120
The area of the triangles, however,
scales according to length squared.

11
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,510
This motivates the much more general field
of scaling analysis, and specifically

12
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,660
dynamic scaling and dynamic similarity,
which are very useful in robotics.

13
00:01:00,982 --> 00:01:05,180
Now instead of triangles, we consider
what happens when you scale cubes.

14
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:12,740
As expected, the area of the cubes is
proportional to the length squared,

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,190
and the volume of the cubes is
proportional to the length cubed.

16
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:20,650
As you can see,
a cube with side length two L, and

17
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,600
be thought of as containing eight
smaller cubes of side length, L.

18
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,160
Suppose you have two ice cubes,
one of side length, L, and

19
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,810
one of side length, 2L, and
they're sitting in the sun.

20
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:36,710
For these ice cubes, the heat that goes
into them is proportional to their surface

21
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:42,246
area and the thermal mass of the ice
cubes is proportional to their volume.

22
00:01:42,246 --> 00:01:47,170
So now scaling will help us answer the
question which ice cube will melt first

23
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,600
and by what factor.

24
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,900
As well as helping us make predictions
about what will happen with even larger or

25
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,590
smaller ice cubes.

26
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,370
Galileo was also very curious about
the implications of scaling in animals.

27
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,150
He observed that bones of different
sizes had different proportions.

28
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,120
In this figure,
we see one of Galileo's sketches,

29
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,400
in which he draws a smaller bone and
a larger bone, where the larger bone

30
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,260
is disproportionately thicker
than the smaller bone.

31
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,010
The question he asked is if a larger
bone that is three times the length

32
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,950
of the smaller bone were to
experience the same stresses

33
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,090
in a larger animal as
compared to a smaller animal.

34
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,628
How much disproportionately thicker
did the larger bone need to be.

35
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:33,920
Just preserving cross-sectional
area as the bone scales

36
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,560
does not however tell the whole story.

37
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,040
Larger animals typically
move relatively more slowly

38
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,489
as measured in body length per
second compared to smaller animals.

39
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,150
Furthermore, larger animals typically
adopts a less probe posture

40
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:49,890
than smaller animals.

41
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:55,490
We now consider how a change in posture
influences a change in loading of

42
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56,785
a cartoon of a bone.

43
00:02:56,785 --> 00:03:00,330
There are five fundamental
types of loading.

44
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,180
Compression is a force parallel
to the axis of the bone,

45
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,650
where the bone is being pushed together.

46
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,960
Tension is also parallel to the axis of
the bone, but it is being pulled apart.

47
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,770
Shear is perpendicular to the axis of
the bone as if it is being slid apart.

48
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,700
Bending is a result of a force
perpendicular to the axis of the bone

49
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,780
coming out of the screen
that is being twisted.

50
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,460
Torsion is the result of a twisting
motion, but parallel with the bone.

51
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:35,890
Here we introduce a fundamental notion of
stress, which is force normalized by area.

52
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,860
Stress is a very important consideration.

53
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,470
Depending on how a part is being loaded,

54
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,570
there's a certain stress
at which it must break.
