1
00:00:07,503 --> 00:00:11,774
In this section, we consider basic
material properties relevant to design.

2
00:00:11,774 --> 00:00:16,540
Material properties of interest, such
as strength and stiffness are typically

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,490
mass normalized and specific strength and
specific stiffness computed.

4
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,570
In this figure,
we see a log log plot of youngs modulus or

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,510
stiffness plotted against density.

6
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,230
In the top right,
we see that there are many metals

7
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,520
at the very favorable high stiffness
at the price of significant density.

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,060
Moving down in stiffness, we see many
ceramics that seem favorable, but

9
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,190
are typically very brittle.

10
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,200
Moving down in stiffness
a little bit more,

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,620
we see composite materials, which will
be of interest later in this section.

12
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:56,065
We now revisit the implications of posture
on stress in a simplified bone model.

13
00:00:56,065 --> 00:00:57,188
In this figure,

14
00:00:57,188 --> 00:01:02,575
we see how changes in posture influence
loading in bones in a simplified model.

15
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:08,240
For a more upright posture,
there is nearly pure compressive loading.

16
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,160
This results in a uniform
stress distribution,

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,070
which in our example does not exceed
the ultimate strength of the material.

18
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:21,545
In the more sprawled animal, we see
a combination of compression and bending.

19
00:01:21,545 --> 00:01:26,450
The principle of superposition let's us
simply add the stress profiles to see

20
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,765
the resulting profile on the right.

21
00:01:28,765 --> 00:01:32,761
This resulting profile has peak
stress above the ultimate strength

22
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:34,300
of the material.

23
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,270
And so in this case, the bone in
the sprawled animal would break.

24
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:42,170
As mentioned, all materials up to
this point have been isotropic.

25
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,814
Which means when loaded in different
conditions, they respond the same way.

26
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:49,425
We now consider anisotropic
materials such as composites,

27
00:01:49,425 --> 00:01:53,755
which have very different responses
depending on loading conditions.

28
00:01:53,755 --> 00:01:58,402
In this video, we see an example
of an anisotropic material that

29
00:01:58,402 --> 00:02:01,594
has a grain similar to
something like wood.

30
00:02:01,594 --> 00:02:04,549
When the material is loaded in
the direction of the grain,

31
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:05,705
it is very compliant.

32
00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:10,646
When it is rotated 90 degrees,
however and loaded against the grain,

33
00:02:10,646 --> 00:02:12,275
it becomes very rigid.

34
00:02:12,275 --> 00:02:13,155
In this video,

35
00:02:13,155 --> 00:02:17,576
we see the implications of combining
two of these samples in different ways.

36
00:02:17,576 --> 00:02:21,738
When the two samples are combines with
that the grains are parallel, once again,

37
00:02:21,738 --> 00:02:26,180
the combined samples are very compliant
when loaded in the direction of the grain.

38
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,844
When the samples are combined, so
that the grains are perpendicular.

39
00:02:29,844 --> 00:02:34,334
We now have a more isotropic material,
which is stiff in both directions.

40
00:02:38,904 --> 00:02:44,350
In this image, we see the robot XRL that
has two different kind of composites.

41
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:48,250
These composites are layered differently
to achieve different material properties.

42
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,209
In both cases,

43
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:54,273
we would like the ultimate strength of
the material to be as high as possible.

44
00:02:54,273 --> 00:02:57,694
In the shell, however,
we prioritize stiffness.

45
00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:59,860
And in the legs, we prioritize compliance.

46
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,500
Now, we consider anisotropic
materials at various scales.

47
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,590
These are known as
hierarchical structures.

48
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,340
In this figure,

49
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:14,010
we see hierarchical structures found
in nature, such as bone and bamboo.

50
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,960
These are both examples of
using hierarchical features

51
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,590
to change the property of
the overall material as distinct

52
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,670
from the material properties
of the constituents.

53
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,530
In this figure,

54
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:30,080
we see the use of hierarchical compliance
in the sticky bot robot, which is able

55
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,780
to keep the toes of the machine a fixed
to a surface, even on irregular terrain.
