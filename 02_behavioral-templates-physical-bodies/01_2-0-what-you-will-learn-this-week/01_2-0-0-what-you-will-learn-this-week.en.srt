00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:25,250
Welcome to week two of our robotics
special course on mobility.

3
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:33,780
This week, we'll be focused on
the components of mobile robots.

4
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:41,490
The components fall into two
major conceptual pieces.

5
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:48,120
First, we want to introduce behavioral
components that we'll call templates.

6
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,282
What's a template?

7
00:00:50,282 --> 00:00:56,170
A template, as an example, is a so
called compass gait, what is that?

8
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:01,310
Think about a wheel rolling down a hill,
think about a spoked wheel

9
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:06,150
rolling down the hill,
take the rim of that wheel off and

10
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,430
think about wheel rolling down the hill.

11
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:15,390
Now take those spokes and think about
their transition from one point,

12
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,860
to the other point, to the other point.

13
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,630
Remove all but two of those spokes,
and let those two spokes oscillate and

14
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,670
suddenly, we've got a compass gait.

15
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,210
That's a very, very,
very simple mechanical system.

16
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,790
Still pretty complicated to understand but

17
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,160
simple enough that we can
understand it pretty thoroughly.

18
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,840
And that dynamical system will turn out
the be the organizing principle for

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,500
many, many quasi-static gaits.

20
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,190
That's a compass gait, it's a template.

21
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,680
Another template is the spring
loaded inverted pendulum.

22
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,230
This is the template for running.

23
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,430
Think about this as the pogo stick.

24
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,420
The pogo stick is even harder to
understand than the compass gait but

25
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,400
still we can understand it pretty well.

26
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,140
It's the organizing principle for almost
all animal running that we know of and

27
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,840
the organizing principle for

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,870
all good running robots that
have been built to date.

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,980
Here is the origin of
the spring loaded inverted

30
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,980
pendulum in robotics introduced by Dr.
Marc Raibert,

31
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:22,840
then a professor at MIT in 1983,
when he first showed us how to think

32
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,490
about dynamical management of
mobility via energy control.

33
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,060
We'll spend a little bit of time
talking about Raibert's wonderful work

34
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,690
which informs much of what's
gone in legged robotics for

35
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,950
the last 30 years since that time.

36
00:02:40,736 --> 00:02:45,905
The second half hour of our week two
will be concerned not with behavioral

37
00:02:45,905 --> 00:02:50,435
components but with the literal physical
components, the materials properties,

38
00:02:50,435 --> 00:02:55,975
the structures, and the power, as I
promised in the original work on week one.

39
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,240
We're going to be thinking about scaling,
strengths of materials,

40
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,890
how the same weight is not adequate
to support the strength of much,

41
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,030
much larger scaled mechanisms.

42
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,590
We'll be thinking about
the materials properties.

43
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,850
What about the compliance
properties of these materials?

44
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,490
How do these compliance
materials scale with weight?

45
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,360
What compliance properties do we want?

46
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,740
How do we choose those materials?

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,510
We'll be thinking about figures
of merit and robustness and

48
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,390
we'll be thinking about how to build novel
materials into novel structures that

49
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,890
have never been built before because
of the revolution in manufacturing

50
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:44,020
brought about by these
MakerBot style devices.

51
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:50,850
The last thing that we'll talk
about in this week of the course

52
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:56,150
will be our actuator technology, the all
important source of force and power.

53
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,370
And the limitations of actuators, and the
possibilities of using actuators as they

54
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:06,190
are today and actuators as they may
be in the future will comprise one

55
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,780
of the most important
components of this week.

56
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,166
Welcome to week two,

57
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:16,980
we'll spend all of this week thinking
about the components but don't

58
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,920
be impatient because those components will
turn into robots in week three and four.
