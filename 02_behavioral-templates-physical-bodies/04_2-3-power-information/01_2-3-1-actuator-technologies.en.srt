1
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:08,050
In this section,
we're going to consider actuators.

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,680
Actuators are very important in leg of
robots because this is how the robot

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,060
exerts forces on the world.

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,550
These forces conserve to either
manipulate the environment or

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,850
manipulate the robot itself.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,080
We're going to consider different
actuation technologies, and

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,280
their respective advantages and
disadvantages.

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,630
The first actuator we'll think about
are hydraulics and pneumatics.

9
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,570
These are typically considered
as actuators, but really,

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,400
they're actually transmissions.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,690
These transmissions rely
on a source of compressed

12
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:43,040
fluid that's usually external
to the actuators themselves.

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,660
For hydraulics, the working fuel is oil.

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,568
Where as for pneumatics,
the working fluid is typically air.

15
00:00:48,568 --> 00:00:53,746
So, for both of these systems, the force
is proportional to the cross-section

16
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:58,560
area of the piston and the power consumed
is proportional to the velocity.

17
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,100
They have very good specific force and

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,020
specific power because of
the decoupled power source.

19
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:10,940
In this video, we have a very simple
example of a hydraulic system.

20
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,660
There are two syringes filled with fluid,
and

21
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,490
as one syringe moves, it causes
the other syringe to move as well.

22
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,880
The force on the syringes and

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,080
displacement both relate to
the surface area of the syringe.

24
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,810
In this video we see a simple
example of a pneumatic system

25
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,210
where moving one cylinder
causes the other to move.

26
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,500
The forces and displacement are also
proportional to the area, however,

27
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,560
because the fluid is compressible,
the relationship isn't as clear.

28
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,640
Friction in the walls of the cylinder
is responsible for this discrepancy.

29
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,110
The innate compliance of the two working
fluids dictates how the systems can work.

30
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,500
In this simple hydraulic system, if we tap
the end of the syringe so that the system

31
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,290
is closed It's almost impossible
to compress the hydraulic fluid.

32
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:04,510
In the pneumatic system, however, if we
cap the syringe, the compressible fluid

33
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:09,880
means that as we push on the cylinder,
we have effectively created an air spring.

34
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,590
These air springs were very useful
in Mark Raibert's early hoppers,

35
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,270
which were all pneumatic.

36
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,400
These pneumatic hoppers used
air as the working fluid.

37
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,280
And that's what's responsible for
the hopping you can see in this video.

38
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,860
However, the spring properties of the leg

39
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,998
are also due to
the compression of the air.

40
00:02:26,998 --> 00:02:32,330
More recent Boston Dynamics robots
use hydraulic transmissions.

41
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,240
In this video,

42
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,750
we see Spot, which is a hydraulic
machine that has an electrical pump.

43
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,770
It's relatively quiet.

44
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,450
In this video, we see LS3, which also
has a hydraulic transmission, but

45
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,634
has a gas engine,
which makes it very loud.

46
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:51,848
[SOUND] Now we consider the implications

47
00:02:51,848 --> 00:02:58,484
on actuation bandwidth
in these transmissions.

48
00:02:58,484 --> 00:03:03,028
Actuation bandwidth is how the amplitude
of the signal decreases as

49
00:03:03,028 --> 00:03:05,510
frequency increases.

50
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,700
Ideally, we would like very
high actuation bandwidth so

51
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,040
that we get significant
amplitude at high frequencies.

52
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,910
In this video, we see a simple pneumatic
system where one cylinder is actuated

53
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,600
externally and we see the implications
of movement in the other cylinder.

54
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,903
The larger cylinder is driven
at increasing speeds and

55
00:03:24,903 --> 00:03:28,864
we can see that the amplitude in
the smaller cylinder decreases.

56
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,170
In this video we see a simple
hydraulic system where the larger

57
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,560
driven cylinder causes displacement
in the smaller cylinder.

58
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,050
As the frequency of the larger
cylinder's drive is increased,

59
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,900
the smaller cylinder's amplitude
decreases, but not as significantly.

60
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,500
This simple demonstration
shows the bandwidth advantages

61
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,550
of hydraulic compared
to pneumatic systems.

62
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,760
Now we consider electromagnetic actuators
typically exemplified by electric motors.

63
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:11,400
These motors have
considerably lower forces and

64
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,510
operate at very high speeds
with high bandwidth.

65
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:18,330
The power costs operate these
motors is typically proportional to

66
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,250
the torque squared.

67
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,240
The operation of these motors is
governed by a speed-torque curve.

68
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,470
This means that the peak torque
is achieved at no speed.

69
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,210
And as speed increases,
the provided torque linearly decreases.

70
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,320
This can be modeled with a force
damper system as seen in this image.

71
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,050
This force damper model is a useful
abstraction of the speed torque curve.

72
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,520
This speed torque curve can be simply
explained by a force damper model.

73
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,200
The force in this Model F is attenuated
by a damper with constant beat.

74
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,550
Again, we see that at no speed, the full
force of the actuator is available.

75
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,530
Whereas at larger speeds,
the damper diminishes the output force.

76
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:05,500
Most electric motors are used in legged
robots with the addition of a gear box.

77
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:11,120
The gearbox effectively increases
the output torque and decreases the speed.

78
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,260
This allows the maximum power
of the actuator to be achieved

79
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,940
at reasonable speeds.

80
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,340
While gears are very helpful to amplify
torque they are also fragile and lossy.

81
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,100
In gear boxes there's considerable static,
dry and viscous friction.

82
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,620
Furthermore the motor's inertia is
reflected through the gear box so

83
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,430
that the inertia at the output is
proportional to the gear ratio squared.

84
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,190
Gil Pratt made famous the notion
of a series elastic actuator

85
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,760
in which a spring is placed
between the load and the motor.

86
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,280
This is very helpful in that it
protects the gears from shock loading

87
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,360
It also improves the compliance
of the system and

88
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,950
it changes force control into
a position control problem.

89
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,490
By changing the effective
length of the spring

90
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,700
forces can be modulated when the actuator
is in contact with the load.

91
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:05,680
For a series elastic system we must add
a series spring to our four stamper model.

92
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:13,499
This spring of stiffness KS is added
between the actuator and the load.

93
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:18,070
So proprioception in legging robotics
is the information about one's own.

94
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,370
Information in this context is
typically a force on the end effector.

95
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,720
It's possible to measure forces with
an explicit sensor at the end effector.

96
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,140
But here we consider forces that are
inferred by displacements at the actuator.

97
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,130
For this to work,
actuator transparency is key,

98
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,540
so that information from the end effector

99
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:45,100
can travel to the actuator without being
significantly attenuated or delayed.

100
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,380
Most delays will come in from any
kind of compliance in the system,

101
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,990
such as a series elastic element.

102
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,490
Actuator transparency is much
improved by now removing the gearbox.

103
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,970
By removing the gearbox,

104
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:07,020
we decrease the attenuation by all the
sources of friction inside the gearbox.

105
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:12,550
These direct drive robots were first
pioneered by Harry Asada in the 80s.

106
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,220
These machines were, however,
not power-autonomous and needed to be

107
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,860
plugged into the ground as well as having
the first link attached to the ground.

108
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,790
In our Minotaur machine,
we have created a power-autonomous,

109
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,470
legged robot that is direct drive.

110
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:33,970
The actuators on the minuter machine
are conventional of the shelf

111
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,680
rotary brushless electric motors.

112
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:42,050
When comparing the actuators in
minuter to actuators in a Rex robot.

113
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,130
We see 100 fold decrease
in reflected inertia

114
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,608
a 50 fold decrease in viscous friction.

115
00:07:48,608 --> 00:07:53,640
And a four-fold decrease in
both static and dry friction.

116
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:58,460
In this video, we see Minotaur taking
a few short steps before making a jump.

117
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,240
What's important to understand here is
that the machine must sense every time

118
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,970
the leg is in contact with the ground.

119
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,810
This is done using proprioception.

120
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:15,240
The actuators in the leg are commanded
to be virtual springs, and

121
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,120
as the leg hits the ground, the deflection
in the virtual springs is measured and

122
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,720
a force at the end effector is estimated.

123
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,750
As you can see, this works reliably and

124
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,230
ground detection is sensed near
the beginning of the stride.

125
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,670
In this video,

126
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:34,900
we see a comparison between two actuators
with very different transparency.

127
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,070
One is direct drive and one has a gearbox.

128
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,520
First we see the direct drive motor,

129
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,310
which is not controlled in any way,
being driven into a fragile egg.

130
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:51,690
We see that the egg does not crack and
that the actuator itself spins.

131
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,520
This spinning means that
position information

132
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,060
can go back into the other system.

133
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,220
In the second part of this video,
we see that a conventional

134
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,010
motor with a gear box is driven
at a similar speed into the egg.

135
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,990
We notice that the egg breaks and
that the actuator has not rotated at all.

136
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,510
This means that no information
can get from the end effector

137
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,410
back into the system.

138
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,000
Now we consider what happens in biology.

139
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,520
Muscles in humans are typically
very high in transparency.

140
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,530
If we consider our series elastic
spring damper model from before,

141
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:32,450
the typical hill muscle model
is very similar looking.

142
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:36,070
But, has the addition of a parallel
spring of spring constant kp.

143
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:42,450
Muscles also have proprioceptive sensors
built in as the muscle spindles can sense

144
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:47,450
the change in length and the Golgi
tendon can sense tension in the muscle.

145
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,100
In this section we considered
the advantages and

146
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,370
disadvantages of various
actuators technologies.

147
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,000
Furthermore we motivated why
it's important to think about

148
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,890
not only how the actuators are able
to exert forces on their environment.

149
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:07,832
But what happens when the environment
exerts forces onto the actuator?
