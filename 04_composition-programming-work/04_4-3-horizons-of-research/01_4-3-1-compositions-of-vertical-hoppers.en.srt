1
00:00:05,417 --> 00:00:09,009
Now we've learned how to think
about a monoped, i.e slipped,

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,950
how can we use this knowledge to
control our robot with multiple legs?

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,307
In this segment and the two following,

4
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:19,961
we'll see a great advantage to taking
a compositional approach to control.

5
00:00:19,961 --> 00:00:24,018
In this section, we'll think about
a multi-legged body as really,

6
00:00:24,018 --> 00:00:27,850
well, a composition of
single-legged bodies.

7
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,840
You might come out a little surprised at
just how much can be accomplished from

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,450
just a little knowledge
of monoped control.

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,620
First, we have to introduce the concept
of a virtual leg, I'll put Raibert here.

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:44,140
Forces and torques exerted on the body
by the set of physical legs and

11
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,900
by the virtual leg are the same.

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,560
Here's a pictorial example
where a body with two legs

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,580
has the two legs tied together,
not literally but maybe through control,

14
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,430
such that the behavior of the body's
the same as the single leg.

15
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,240
How do we go about
implementing virtual legs?

16
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,360
We have to first think about controlling
the legs within the group i.e,

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,350
the legs with the loop of wire
around them in this picture.

18
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,194
The first thing we have to think about
is positioning the toe in flight for

19
00:01:15,194 --> 00:01:16,149
the virtual leg.

20
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:19,012
This involves positioning
multiple toes for

21
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:23,390
the physical legs such that the virtual
toe is at the right position.

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,260
The second thing we have to think about
is touchdown synchronization to make sure

23
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:34,160
that all of the physical legs within
a group touch down at the same time, ie,

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,760
the time that the vertical
leg touches down.

25
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,000
And lastly, we have to think about
positioning the virtual hip.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,900
You can see that the virtual hip is
somewhere between the physical hips

27
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,680
in the picture above.

28
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,390
And we can actually control the location
of the virtual hip by controlling

29
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:54,840
the internal forces exerted by the
physical hips, as well as differential,

30
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,790
axial leg forces.

31
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:03,159
Lastly, I'll point out that behavior,
which we'll see lots of examples of,

32
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:06,925
is actually just simply a monoped
using this virtual legs idea.

33
00:02:06,925 --> 00:02:12,994
You cannot just have virtual monopeds,
we can also have virtual bipeds.

34
00:02:12,994 --> 00:02:14,554
Here's a picture, again,

35
00:02:14,554 --> 00:02:19,450
from Raibert's book, where we see
examples of a bunch of virtual bipeds.

36
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,593
And with virtual bipeds,
legs operate in pairs, but essentially,

37
00:02:22,593 --> 00:02:23,904
they're one-foot gates.

38
00:02:23,904 --> 00:02:26,942
What this means is that
the control action is mirrored and

39
00:02:26,942 --> 00:02:28,850
repeated from one step to the next.

40
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,680
All of the gates in this pictorial example
are found in horses, for instance.

41
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,497
A chart is a virtual biped where
the virtual hips are located at

42
00:02:40,497 --> 00:02:42,080
the center of mass.

43
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,535
In a piece, the virtual hips are located
close to each other, but on the lateral,

44
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:49,270
the opposite sides of the body.

45
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,660
Whereas in the bound,
the hips are far apart from each other and

46
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,470
there's a pronounced pitching of the body.

47
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:59,540
We can control the virtual hip location
and choose between these different gaits

48
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,860
by using some of the methods that I
talked about in the previous slide.

49
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,630
Here's an example of our very own
minitaur implementing a bounding gait.

50
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:12,628
I'll put out that each hip of minitaur
in this video just thinks of itself as

51
00:03:12,628 --> 00:03:13,716
a vertical hopper.

52
00:03:13,716 --> 00:03:17,950
The front has no knowledge of the back and
the back has no knowledge of the front.

53
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,365
Remember for a bound as we
talk about in previous slide,

54
00:03:22,365 --> 00:03:26,640
we would like the phases of the vertical
hoppers to be asynchronized,

55
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,640
out of phase, this particular phase offset
is actually passively stable because

56
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,031
of the body dynamics.

57
00:03:33,031 --> 00:03:36,430
We'll see a more active control of
the phase offset in the next segment.

58
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,907
I'll point out here that the bound looks
more natural at higher speeds than

59
00:03:41,907 --> 00:03:45,035
the lower speeds since animals
tend to bound at higher speeds.

60
00:03:45,035 --> 00:03:47,475
At slower speeds, they tend to walk.

61
00:03:47,475 --> 00:03:52,484
To summarize, multi-legged robots can be
controlled as compositions of monopeds.

62
00:03:52,484 --> 00:03:56,543
Virtual legs allow you to think of
multiple legs as a single virtual leg and

63
00:03:56,543 --> 00:03:59,070
coordinate them accordingly.

64
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,620
A virtual biped with
a leg-to-leg symmetric control

65
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,640
is actually just a composition
of identical monopeds, and

66
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,710
phase coordination can be
either passive as we saw for

67
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:14,950
the bound in this segment or it can be
activ as we'll see in the next segment.
