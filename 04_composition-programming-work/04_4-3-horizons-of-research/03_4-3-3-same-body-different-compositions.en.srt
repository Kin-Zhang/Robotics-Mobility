00:00:06,146 --> 00:00:09,730
Last segment we looked at
reusing templates on bodies.

2
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,220
There's another facet of composition
that's useful even with a single body.

3
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,980
Sometimes there are different ways
to anchor the same templates.

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,520
Since the bodies are coupled,

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,730
a single actuator output may
affect many degrees of freedom and

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,970
we have some flexibility of choosing how
the actuator controls a degree of freedom.

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,040
For this section we need to
introduce a new template.

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,370
We've already seen pitch control for
as well as for Jerboa.

9
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,999
So, let's remember how that works.

10
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,730
Let's say we have an actuator which
could be a virtual hip torque or

11
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,700
a physical hip torque or anything else.

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,430
And we have an attitude degree of
freedom which is essentially an angle.

13
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,570
And what we do is we choose
the torque to be a PD controller or

14
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,960
similar servo on the angle
that we're trying to control.

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,600
Now we introduce a new template which
is called tailed reorientation.

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,080
Bodies with a tail have this
internal shape angle which

17
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,830
you can find out more
about from this paper.

18
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:14,417
And what we can do is allow the tail to
work and affect the internal shape angle,

19
00:01:14,417 --> 00:01:15,749
to reorient the body.

20
00:01:19,975 --> 00:01:24,397
Let's take SLIP on Jerboa from the
previous segment, and now remove the boom,

21
00:01:24,397 --> 00:01:27,080
which was locking the body pitch.

22
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,310
What we're going to do is let the hip
torque control the body pitch and

23
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,340
stance, and the tail torque
control the shape angle in flight.

24
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,370
This is what that looks like.

25
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,870
Empirical work is really in progress.

26
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,835
And some of the reasons why
these experiments are difficult

27
00:01:44,835 --> 00:01:48,280
are that you need very
good orientation sensing.

28
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,990
These experiments are also sensitive to
the location of the center of mass which

29
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,880
is why I have to have this unicorn horn to
move the center of mass further forward.

30
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,670
Essentially what we've done is
we've extended Raibert's ideas

31
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,540
from his original three degree of freedom
planar hopper to this much more coupled,

32
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,340
four degree of freedom tailed system.

33
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,730
So is that the only way
to get your robot to hop?

34
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,140
Well let's see, the answer is no.

35
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,330
Here's an example that
just borrows Rex's idea

36
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,782
of having the hip energize
a SLIP like behavior.

37
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,280
The C legs in this video are here
primarily because we could not get enough

38
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,880
traction with the point legs.

39
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,600
But we don't really thinks that that's
that important for the behavior.

40
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,680
So the hips control the slip
degrees of freedom and

41
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,480
the tail then needs to control the body
angle as well as the shape angle.

42
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,360
This video shows one way in which the tail
can control attitude degrees of freedom

43
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,510
by interacting with the ground.

44
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:51,037
You'll remember from section 3.2
by using tails to interact with

45
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,789
the ground is not unusual
even in the animal kingdom.

46
00:02:58,653 --> 00:03:01,410
Okay, so
we have two ways that Jerboa could hop.

47
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,950
The two ways have important differences.

48
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,050
The hip energized hopping is faster.

49
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,880
It actually goes seven to
eight body lengths per second.

50
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,450
But, the tail energized
hopping needs less traction,

51
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,449
which could be important if you're
trying to hop on the slippery surface.

52
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,400
Additionally, they impose different
morphological constraints.

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,850
We haven't spoken about this before,
but when we anchor templates,

54
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,610
there is a push forward of
controllers from template to body.

55
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,160
But complimentary to this to use
the template controllers we need to

56
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,000
pull back some of the body's parameters.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,140
This is a topic of active research as you
can see from the reference in this slide.

58
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,100
But this morphological
reduction imposes constraints

59
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,780
on the allowable parameter
space of the body.

60
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,430
In this instance, the hip/g-energized
hopping seems to prefer

61
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,490
a different location for the center of
mass than the tail-energized hopping.

62
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,930
To summarize, having alternate
solutions is a good thing.

63
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,970
What we've done is we've shown you two
ways that Jerboa can hop in the plane.

64
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,590
And the different environmental conditions
might make us prefer one solution

65
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,180
over the other.
