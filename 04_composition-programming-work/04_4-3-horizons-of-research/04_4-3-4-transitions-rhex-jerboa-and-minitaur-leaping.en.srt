1
00:00:06,704 --> 00:00:09,663
So far, we have been looking
at steady state behaviors,

2
00:00:09,663 --> 00:00:14,050
which means that the energy of
the robot changes slowly, if at all.

3
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,690
This last segment of the course,
we'll look at leaping.

4
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,620
Leaping really involves
rapid changes in energy.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,070
And that brings in very different
techniques that we need for analysis.

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,240
Here are two videos of Jerboa.

7
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,110
On the left it's doing the hopping
we saw on the previous segment, and

8
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:33,800
on the right it's doing a leaping behavior
to try and get on top of this box.

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,420
Which would you guess is
the easier behavior to analyze?

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,940
The answer is, by far,
the one on the left.

11
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,700
The behavior on the right is
called transitional behavior.

12
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:48,850
And the analytical difficulty with that
is that it can't be encoded in terms of

13
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:53,340
basins and generalized energy,
like we showed in section 4.1.

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,310
However, it's not always so bad.

15
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,080
Here's a video of me rolling a ball
on a table and a makeshift corner.

16
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,510
The ball has one or more impacts
with the boxes on the sides, and for

17
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,500
the most part,
bounces away from the corner.

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:14,000
This deceptively simple demonstration
exposes some of the nasty underbelly

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,050
of hybrid systems, though.

20
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:20,460
Notice that for the concave corner, even
though the initial velocity is variable,

21
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,100
the final velocity is relatively
stable to perturbations.

22
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,010
However, in the convex corner,
the opposite is true.

23
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,910
Even small variations in initial velocity

24
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:36,900
cause the ball to diverge completely
into different final velocities.

25
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,480
So the first concave corner results
in a convergent transition,

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,990
whereas in the second case,
we get a divergent one.

27
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,688
The first example where this is relevant
is a pronking leap for Minitaur,

28
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:51,230
as you can see in these videos.

29
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,940
Through our virtual leg coordination
anchoring effort, we can try and

30
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,540
ensure that the multiple legs
touch down at the same time.

31
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,674
But in practice they all touch down
at slightly different times, but

32
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:07,393
the advantage is that these
impacts are usually convergent.

33
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:11,466
You can try this at home by
picking up a chair or a table and

34
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:15,210
lightly dropping it about
one inch off the ground.

35
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,633
And you can see that the final condition
is relatively independent of how you drop

36
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:21,040
the chair.

37
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,060
The same is true of Minitaur.

38
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,960
And a lot of the time we can ignore
the variability of how it lands and

39
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,600
instead focus on composing the behavior
using sequential parallel composition

40
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,850
that we learned about before.

41
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,685
All of these are just the bounding and

42
00:02:36,685 --> 00:02:39,710
pronking that we've seen
in the previous segments.

43
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,030
With added vertical energy for one stride.

44
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:47,560
The vertical leap is about two and half
times MInitaur's normal standing height.

45
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,909
You might be thinking, my cat can
jump higher than that, probably true.

46
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:54,850
In an absolute height you could
probably jump higher than that as well.

47
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,120
But try without bending your knees or
your ankle.

48
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,510
You might see that it's extremely
hard to jump without knees.

49
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,200
RHex and Jerboa are two robots that
don't have any active knees or

50
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,520
ankles, that is,
it can't actively extend its leg.

51
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,670
We've been able to make RHex and
Jerboa perform leaping behaviors as well.

52
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,770
Using their legs and

53
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:24,230
body together to go through a sequence of
hybrid transitions before going airborne.

54
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,130
I've shown you a brief set of samples
here where you can look up RHex and

55
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,150
Jerboa leaping on YouTube to
see a more full selection of

56
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,490
the leaps possible on this way.

57
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:39,438
To manage the exploding complexity of
the hybrid transitions, Aaron Johnson

58
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:44,373
came up with this object called
the ground reaction complex, or GRC.

59
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:49,370
The GRC is really a mathematical structure
for bookkeeping the hybrid transitions.

60
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:54,470
Here's an example of a GRC for
a planar, one legged robot.

61
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:58,110
This is actually what you'd get if
you removed the tail from Jerboa.

62
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,620
In each cartoon,
the cyan dot represents an active contact,

63
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,170
and the magenta dots
represent inactive contacts.

64
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:10,245
And maybe you can see how
the GRC is constructed.

65
00:04:10,245 --> 00:04:14,975
The most surprising thing we found is
that when given a similar leap command,

66
00:04:14,975 --> 00:04:18,978
in certain ranges, RHex and
Jerboa produce very similar leaps,

67
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:20,750
as you can see in this image.

68
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,470
The question then,
obviously, is why, and when.

69
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:31,110
The answer to this question is not easy,
and is a topic of active research.

70
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,350
But for now, we suspect the answer has
to do with ranges of conditions when,

71
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,100
to refer back to my earlier demonstration,

72
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,770
the ball rolls into a concave
angle versus a convex angle.

73
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:49,280
In this image, each data point is
the apex state of a leap made by RHex

74
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,230
on the left and Jerboa on the right.

75
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:55,990
And you can see that there
are regions of leap commands which

76
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,900
produced very similar trends
in the final apex state.

77
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:06,689
As I mentioned before, analyzing why
is still the topic of active research.

78
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:10,559
To summarize, transitions go
through various hybrid modes,

79
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:15,110
which makes them difficult to
analyze with energy basins.

80
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,140
Some transitions are nicer than others,
though.

81
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,492
Minitaur leaps fall in the nice category,
and the leaps can mostly be

82
00:05:22,492 --> 00:05:27,084
implemented and analyzed using
parallel and sequential composition.

83
00:05:27,084 --> 00:05:31,120
RHex and Jerboa leaps, on the other hand,
are much more difficult to analyze, and

84
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,130
we're beginning to do so
using the ground reaction complex.
