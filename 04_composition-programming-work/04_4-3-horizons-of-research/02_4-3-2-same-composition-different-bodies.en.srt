1
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,963
Now that we've had a first look at
how compositions can be useful,

2
00:00:09,963 --> 00:00:14,700
the second benefit is the ability to
reuse compositions across bodies.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,405
After all, the template controllers
that we saw for slip in section

4
00:00:19,405 --> 00:00:23,650
4.2 are simple enough that they should
be useful from multiple bodies.

5
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,550
There's usually no problem in implementing
them with the available actuators

6
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,580
in different types of robots.

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,470
And so in this section,
we'll try to do that.

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,800
We'll assume also the ability to embed the
template without worrying too much about

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,260
available actuators or verification.

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,980
Here's a video of Jerboa
hopping in the plain.

11
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,150
What we've done here,

12
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,650
is taken the vertical hopping that
we saw in the previous segment and

13
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,370
added in a stepping controller
to position the toe in flight.

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,470
The vertical hopping is energized by
the tail, which is specific to the Jerboa.

15
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,957
In addition, I'll point out here,

16
00:00:59,957 --> 00:01:04,830
that the large carbon fiber tube in the
foreground of this video is called a boom.

17
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,708
And what it's doing here, is it's
constraining additional degrees of freedom

18
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:12,440
of the robot, think of it as
training wheels for the robot.

19
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,610
Before we're ready to control all of
the degrees of freedom of the robot,

20
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,010
we constrain some of them and
test out our controllers.

21
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,670
Here the boom is constraining
the pitch of the robot,

22
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,250
as well as restricting
it to the sagittal pane.

23
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,550
The next segment will allow the pitch
to roam free and see what happens.

24
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,792
We can also use the same idea where
the virtual legs on Minitaur.

25
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:36,310
Jerboa was a monoped but
Minitaur has multiple legs.

26
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,290
But what we're going to do is coordinate
two of the legs as if they are one,

27
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,690
as we saw in the previous segment.

28
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,040
The virtual leg control ends up being
actually identical to Jerboa, which is

29
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,020
a little surprising but is really showing
off the power of parallel composition.

30
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,120
The within group control ends up
controlling the pitch of the body.

31
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,020
The differential axial leg forces ends
up being a virtual hip torque, and

32
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,590
we can just use the Raibert pitch rolling
idea to control the pitch of the body.

33
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,800
Here's a video of Minitaur pronking.

34
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,171
It's similar to the bounding
in a lot of ways,

35
00:02:13,171 --> 00:02:15,499
except we've added this
pitch coordination.

36
00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:20,513
We're able to get this behavior in a day
or two, while working on the bounding and

37
00:02:20,513 --> 00:02:24,220
this goes to show the power of
reuse from compositionally.

38
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,680
Now that I've shown you our hasty
efforts of getting mentor ranking.

39
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,660
Here's what an African
springbok looks like.

40
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,980
I'm showing you this because firstly, it's
good to be a little in awe of animals.

41
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,600
It just goes to show what steps we have to
take to catch up both technologically and

42
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,880
conceptually.

43
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,880
Secondly, this behavior is extremely and
energetically inefficient.

44
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,260
The spring box use it to either confuse
predators or it's just show off.

45
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,950
Neither which are really
applicable to the robot.

46
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,150
Remember, that we like Bioinspiration but
we're not trying to do biomimicry.

47
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,790
To summarize a lot of what we just saw,

48
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,760
I'll point out that we're not the first
researchers to implement vertical hopping.

49
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,430
Here's Raibert's vertical
hopper from the 1980s.

50
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,039
Here's Jerboa, using his tail to
hop up and down in 2014 or 15.

51
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,650
His Minitaur, using it's virtual
legs to hop up and down.

52
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,970
And here's another robot we have in
the lab called the delta hopper,

53
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,550
which is a three legged freedom
special hopper hoping up and down.

54
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:32,080
It seems sensible that we should be able
to reuse some of our control ideas across

55
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,110
this vastly different bodies.

56
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:38,710
After all, biomechanists and
roboticists agree, that the slip model, or

57
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:44,950
just a mass on a spring, is a good enough
explanation for a lot of animal behaviors.

58
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,480
This idea of reuse is one of
the most important advantages

59
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,130
of a compositional way of
constructing controllers.

60
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,330
The next immediate benefit is that
having a library of templates and

61
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:59,050
template controllers automatically
suggests new combinations of them.

62
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,960
In this light, I'll describe two
combinations which create a new behaviors

63
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,640
which were useful for Minitaur.

64
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,800
Say we have a library of these three
controllers of vertical hopping.

65
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,850
A rimless wheel and a pitch control.

66
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,040
By using the pitch control
primitive in the horizontal plane,

67
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,278
we can actually get Minitaur to turn,
something that is not immediately

68
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:25,460
obvious because Minitaur only
has sagittal plane activation.

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,520
Additionally, by using the pitch
control idea in the roll direction, and

70
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,980
by changing the roll offset from zero.

71
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,260
We can get it to do this crabbing behavior
laterally, which is really unusual and

72
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,690
surprising.

73
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,380
I'm actually going to leave the most
visually appealing of these

74
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,060
generative combinations till
the next segment, leaping.

75
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,570
These ideas of reusing in generating,

76
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:52,500
might remind you of something we're all
very familiar with, spoken language.

77
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,870
After all, if I have a new thought,
I'm usually able to find the words

78
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,830
that I've learned previously
to describe it, usually.

79
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,834
This is not a coincidental connection.

80
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:05,212
It's happened for
computer science, in fact,

81
00:05:05,212 --> 00:05:08,750
which is why there are numerous
programming languages that let computer

82
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,660
programmers express themselves
from simple primitives.

83
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,968
And a language for programming work,
or robots, is indeed something for

84
00:05:15,968 --> 00:05:18,240
roboticists to strive towards.

85
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,900
So let's take stock of where
compositional techniques lie.

86
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,840
I've made a crude table here, where
Compositional techniques are on the right.

87
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,180
And for lack of a better term,
the Holistic techniques,

88
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,180
where you must model the whole robot,
and generate a controller for

89
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,730
all of the degrees of freedom
at once are on the left.

90
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,770
The first thing roboticists care
about is stability guarantees.

91
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,010
We'd really like to know
that our behavior is stable.

92
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,500
For holistic techniques,

93
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,550
there are several methods that you
could look up in the literature.

94
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,170
For compositional controllers, we could
use some of the same techniques but

95
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,660
what we'd really like to do,
is be able to leverage

96
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,710
templates stability properties
which are much simpler to analyze.

97
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:03,560
And somehow, be able to guarantee that
the body is stable under composition.

98
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,360
We haven't figure this how yet,
but there's been some progress.

99
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,071
Second point is Underactuation,

100
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:13,461
where we'd like a few actuators to
control many degrees and freedom.

101
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,697
There are a few holistic techniques.

102
00:06:16,697 --> 00:06:20,235
For instance, if you had a linear
controllable system you could use a linear

103
00:06:20,235 --> 00:06:22,944
quadratic regulator to generate
control inputs for you,

104
00:06:22,944 --> 00:06:25,690
that would control all of
your degrees of freedom.

105
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,260
However, techniques like this would
require very good models which are often

106
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,470
hard to get.

107
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,310
In contrary, for compositional techniques,

108
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,540
if the template isn't actuated like we
want, there's very little we can do.

109
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,950
We'll see in the next
section how we leverage

110
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:45,290
body coupling to channel one
actuator into different templates.

111
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,210
The third point is Optimality guarantees.

112
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,340
Optimal control,

113
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,390
lets us think about this in a principled
way with holistic techniques.

114
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,130
However, in the compositional domain,

115
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:02,480
we're actively restricting the set
of controllers we can use, and

116
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,180
hence, we can't really have
these guarantees anymore.

117
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,520
Given these tradeoffs,

118
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,380
what are some of the benefits we
have from compositional techniques?

119
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,310
In terms of modelling and

120
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:16,320
calibration, most of the holistic
methods must be quite precise.

121
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,470
However, the compositional techniques
can survive with much cruder models.

122
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:26,671
After all the templates plans are only
crude representations of our bodies and

123
00:07:26,671 --> 00:07:31,344
the template controllers are chosen for
their large ability basins.

124
00:07:31,344 --> 00:07:35,390
Next, the controller synthesis for
compositional techniques is very easy.

125
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:40,120
Because each template can be thought of
as a single input single output system,

126
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,300
making the number of parameters
to think about much smaller.

127
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,710
However, in the holistic setting
the number of parameters for

128
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:52,710
this n input n output system
might be quite large.

129
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,500
It often goes exponentially, and
the number of parameters you have to think

130
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,440
about, when developing the controller,
is very large.

131
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,560
Lastly, the ability to reuse and generate
controllers, which we just talked about in

132
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,380
the previous slides, is one of the best
selling points of compositional control.

133
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:12,777
To summarize, a compositional approach to
synthesis allows us to reuse templates

134
00:08:12,777 --> 00:08:15,494
that we've learned already
on different robots.

135
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:19,778
As well as to generate new behaviors
that we might not have even thought of.
