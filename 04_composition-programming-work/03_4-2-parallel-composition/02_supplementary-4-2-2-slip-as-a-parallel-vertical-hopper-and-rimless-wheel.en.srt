1
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:08,418
In this segment we are going to talk
a little bit about the verification step

2
00:00:08,418 --> 00:00:10,410
that I mentioned at
the end of the last video.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,130
This entails some formalism of
an analysis but as we'll see

4
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:20,600
in later segment is not critical to the
conceptual ideas of parallel composition.

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,540
Let's look at SLIP as
a parallel composition.

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,300
Just like Reword did, but
we'll add in some formalism so

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,630
that we can really see what's going on.

8
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:31,330
So the first template in action is
a controlled one degree of freedom,

9
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:31,980
vertical hopper.

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,830
Here's a video of the Pengerboa
which I introduced in week three

11
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,730
doing a vertical hopping.

12
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,040
But it's implemented actually
with the tail wagging up and

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,530
down against the passive legs.

14
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,560
This just goes to show you that a pogo
stick need not look like a pogo stick.

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,770
What we really care about is
the behavior of the dynamical system.

16
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,770
A vertical hopper can be described in
phase energy coordinates in this way,

17
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,710
where a represents the energy
of the vertical hopper and

18
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,100
this angular coordinate,
psi, represents the phase.

19
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,800
You can see that even if the input,
u, were zero,

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,550
the energy would stay conserved, but the
phase would keep going at a rate, omega.

21
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:23,150
What we choose to do with this system,
is introduce a controller that energizes

22
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,730
in an oscillatory fashion trying to
compensate for the natural dumping.

23
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,570
Here's an example of
an Oscillatory energization.

24
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,120
Here the k term energizes the system and

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,690
the a times beta term is really
the natural dumping of the system.

26
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:46,680
Which, as intuition should point out,
increases as the energy increases.

27
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,340
The analysis of the system is made
simpler by a particular approximation

28
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,950
that's called dynamical averaging.

29
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,340
And without going into
the details too much,

30
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,780
you get something like this very simple
first order linear time in variant ODE.

31
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,890
Which you should be able to solve.

32
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,810
The next template we have to consider is
the Rimless wheel which I have introduced

33
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,460
but now let's think about it as
a model only for forward speed.

34
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,058
The Rimless wheel has more
than one degree of freedom but

35
00:02:16,058 --> 00:02:19,273
here we'll only care about the speed
that which it rolls down the hill

36
00:02:21,978 --> 00:02:25,782
What we'll do with the rimless wheel
is we'll add a lift off torque so

37
00:02:25,782 --> 00:02:29,320
that it's an active rimless wheel and
not just passive.

38
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:34,021
This is not dissimilar to the Cornell
Ranger pictured here which used lift off

39
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:38,666
ankle torques to walk a huge distance
with a minimal expenditure of energy.

40
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:45,370
Let's take a simplistic view of
the dynamics of the rimless wheel.

41
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,340
The continuous dynamics
are pretty well captured

42
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,260
by this equation with suggest that
the energy of the rimless wheel

43
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:58,169
increases by a fixed amount due to
the rolling every continuous phase.

44
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,410
The impacts,

45
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,910
on the other hand, take away energy where
you can really think about the impacts as

46
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,610
being kind of a coefficient of restitution
effect, as suggested by this equation.

47
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:16,691
Together, you get this equation for
the return map, where intuitively, some

48
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:21,105
energy is added and some energy is taken
away to give you a stable forward speed.

49
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:28,489
What's interesting is that the simplicity
view has a one to one mapping to what

50
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:33,360
were did templement forward speed
control on his hopping robot.

51
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,990
The mechanism by which that happened

52
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:39,390
was a stepping controller where
the toe is positioned in flight.

53
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,670
There's no rimless wheel in that
setting but there's really a one to one

54
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,660
correspondence between the rimless
wheel and the stepping example.

55
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,894
In the stepping example there's
a particular stepping angle called

56
00:03:51,894 --> 00:03:55,471
the neutral angle which results
in zero change in speed and

57
00:03:55,471 --> 00:04:01,070
by serving around the neutral angle you
can control your speed effectively.

58
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:05,460
Together, these two templates
give us a stable hopping behavior

59
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,760
as I've shown you before and
as Rayburn has demonstrated before.

60
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,780
Unfortunately, it turns out that
implementing the parallel composition is

61
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,470
much easier than analyzing it.

62
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,980
This is really the main
part of this section.

63
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,700
So the question is,
does SLIP anchor a vertical hopper?

64
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,420
What does this question mean?

65
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,510
If we go back to full
encoded tap templates and

66
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,600
anchor is what we're asking
is are the dynamics of slip

67
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,890
the same as the vertical hopper in some in
variance sub manifold of it's dynamics.

68
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,640
So how does one go about
proving an anchoring?

69
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,089
This really by demonstrating that there's
a conjugacy of the form just mentioned.

70
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:47,280
But proving that there isn't a conjugacy,
or there isn't an anchoring is much

71
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,080
more difficult because logically you'd
have to search all possible conjugacies.

72
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,050
However, I will go over the most natural
coordinate change here, and even though it

73
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,050
won't be a proof, hopefully you will see
how this process is quite difficult.

74
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:06,520
Here the continuous dynamics corresponding
to the extension of the leg in SLIP.

75
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,540
The first term,
corresponds to the spring force.

76
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,570
The second term,
to gravity and the third term,

77
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,980
to the centrifugal force felt by
the mass as it's spins above the toe.

78
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:25,000
If we define the states base we really
get something like this equation for

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,830
the dynamics.

80
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,310
Let's compare to a vertical hopper
where a lot of it is the same but

81
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,840
there are few critical differences.

82
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,260
Firstly, gravity is not meet
projected about the angle data and

83
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,130
there's no centrifugal force.

84
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,350
For this trivial but
kind of obvious change of coordinates,

85
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:51,390
we see that the dynamics are the same only
if data is zero and data dot is zero.

86
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,890
What these means is that
the leg is really vertical and

87
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,050
hopping vertically and
has no speed at all.

88
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,980
So you can see that it's very challenging

89
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,190
to prove this anchoring because it doesn't
exist for any non-zero forward speed.

90
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,330
Some new research that we're doing is
trying to show that instead of anchoring

91
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,640
the exact dynamics sef.

92
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:17,800
There's approximation f bar that
has this correspondence and

93
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,040
has all the stability
properties that we require.

94
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,920
To summarize SLIP can actually be
decomposed into a vertical hopper and

95
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,610
a rimless wheel.

96
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,510
A vertical hopper can be
controlled by active damping.

97
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,560
A rimless wheel can be controlled
by active liftoff impulse.

98
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,780
SLIP as a composition works
very well in simulation and

99
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:47,090
in practice but showing that this
anchoring is exact is almost impossible.

100
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,980
Approximate versions of this
anchoring might be more feasible.
