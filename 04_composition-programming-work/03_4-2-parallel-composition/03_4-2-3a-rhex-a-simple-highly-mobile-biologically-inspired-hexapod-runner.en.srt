1
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:10,665
Now it's time to talk about
an empirically instantiated version

2
00:00:10,665 --> 00:00:15,885
of anchoring that's been very
successful in the physical world,

3
00:00:15,885 --> 00:00:21,120
that we still have only part
understanding of, mathematically.

4
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,840
But gives you a good feeling for
what can happen,

5
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:35,360
when a simple template as Jeff
talked to you about in week three.

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:42,818
Gets anchored in a complicated but
useful body.

7
00:00:42,818 --> 00:00:50,317
In the year 2000-2001 Martin Buehler,
then a professor at McGale University,

8
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:55,548
designed a new hexapedal machine
together with Uluc Saranli,

9
00:00:55,548 --> 00:00:59,890
then a graduate student at
university of Michigan,

10
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:05,238
now a professor at Middle Eastern
Techno University in Turkey.

11
00:01:05,238 --> 00:01:12,640
Their machine that they named RHex had
only six motors, one for each hip.

12
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,020
And indeed, that's what they
received their patent for,

13
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,954
a one actuator per hip
compliant legged hexapod.

14
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,510
This underactuation concept had been
pioneered by Buehler in the decade prior.

15
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:39,150
And he was convinced that it was crucial
to achieve adequate specific power

16
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,510
as we have described before being a very
scarce resource in legged mobility.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,180
He took the single spoke rimless wheel
concept that McGeer has pioneered in 1990,

18
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:59,510
and he added that to compliance and
single actualization

19
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:04,580
to come up with a machine that
broke all previous records.

20
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,780
For not simply speed, it clocked
in at one body length per second.

21
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,660
Which was about an order of magnitude
greater than any other machine

22
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,490
that was unplugged had achieved with legs.

23
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:24,860
It had a reasonable specific resistance,
you'll remember from the first segment.

24
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,830
That specific resistance as
a measure of cost of transport.

25
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,830
This machine not only had an order of
magnitude greater speed, but it was

26
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:39,930
arguably the first legged machine to run
over highly irregular broken ground.

27
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:46,960
Here, you see a movie of some of the first
rugged steps that RHex took back in 2001,

28
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,090
and it was very much inspired by the movie

29
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,988
you've seen of the cockroaches
studied by Professor Full at Berkeley.

30
00:02:56,988 --> 00:03:00,876
This badly broken and
complicated landscape

31
00:03:00,876 --> 00:03:05,486
had never before been
traversed by legged machines.

32
00:03:14,346 --> 00:03:19,120
We've discussed the cost of
transport as a measure of

33
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,160
efficiency in the first segment, and here.

34
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,160
I would say that Martin also broke new
ground by showing that the cost of

35
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,680
transport increased over this rugged
terrain, but didn't go through the roof.

36
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,630
And so this machine had
a cost of transport that was

37
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,980
reasonable over level ground, and not at
all unreasonable over badly broken ground.

38
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,130
And so with this specific
resistance of less than ten

39
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:50,040
as you'll see from the charts
if you go back to segment 1.1.1,

40
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,360
is still actually quite reasonable and
was unusual for its time.

41
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:01,950
We believe that this is the consequence
of the dynamical design, and

42
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,570
we have good empirical reason,
as I will now discuss.

43
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,830
But as you will see,

44
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,400
the mathematical underpinnings of
these ideas are still underdeveloped.

45
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:19,810
What can we say about this invention that
had a number of very new properties?

46
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,350
Broke new ground, so
to speak, in legged robotics.

47
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,540
Well, empirically we can say a lot.

48
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,240
Mathematically, we have a little
bit less understanding.

49
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,590
Let's first remember the notion of
anchoring that was brought up in

50
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,620
the previous segment.

51
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,360
Remember that an anchored template is one

52
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,200
which lives in a higher
degree of freedom body,

53
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,980
even though it has only very few
degrees of freedom that count.

54
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,460
This concept was introduced in robotics,
arguably, by Mark Raibert as well,

55
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,630
the guy we've talked about who built
those Ooiginal hopping pogo sticks.

56
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,170
Mark built,
in addition to literal pogo sticks,

57
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:14,340
he built this mechanism,
that I'm showing in the figure,

58
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:20,560
which was a quadrupedal version
of his bipedal hopping machine.

59
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,390
He took two of his bipedal machines and

60
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:29,460
he yoked them together through a body,
and he had a quadruped.

61
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,450
He had two hydraulic degrees of
actuated freedom and one pneumatic

62
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:40,570
actuator per leg, so each of these legs
had three actuated degrees of freedom.

63
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,670
They were plugged into the wall and
so, there was no power problem.

64
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:50,604
And what Mark was able to do was
exhibit bounding, pronking, pacing,

65
00:05:50,604 --> 00:05:51,848
trotting gaits.

66
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:57,952
Unfortunately, we don't have time in this
little module to talk about gaits and

67
00:05:57,952 --> 00:05:58,948
gait space.

68
00:05:58,948 --> 00:06:03,750
But, the gates of animals and the gates
of robots are a wonderful important area.

69
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,780
We'll just ignore it.

70
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,880
We'll just assume that you have
an intuitive idea of what bounding and

71
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,860
pronking, and pacing,
and trotting might be.

72
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:14,280
Mark was able to exhibit,
on his quadrupedal machine,

73
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,710
all of these combinations of
gaits by very simple manipulation

74
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:25,450
of the individual hopping pieces,
the hopping legs.

75
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:29,520
We'll come back to this idea when
we talk about parallel composition

76
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,570
more carefully in the next segment.

77
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:37,730
For this segment, we'd like to focus
on what it was that these pogo

78
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:43,120
stick like machines were able to do that
made them so interesting and valuable.

79
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,050
What Mark was able to show was
that by coordinating the legs and

80
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:54,000
the gait pattern successfully,
he could fool the ground

81
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,992
to thinking that this quadrupedal
machine was really a one-legged,

82
00:06:58,992 --> 00:07:01,740
spring-loaded inverted pendulum.

83
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,440
As we're suggesting in the trace

84
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,830
of the various energies that he
recorded off of his machine.

85
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:18,650
Now, there had not yet been a off-the-wall

86
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:23,070
power autonomous machine to even run,
much less to run

87
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:27,000
in this spring-loaded inverted pendulum
like way, which is what the animals do.

88
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:34,770
What we found when we were able to
tune RHex properly was that it,

89
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,230
together with it's legs,
when it tuned up properly,

90
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:45,890
exhibited motions that I'll now
show in the video at slow motion.

91
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:52,750
I think you can see if you look at this
video carefully in slow motion that

92
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:58,090
the mass center of the body of
this machine is pitching up and

93
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:03,740
down, and back and forth much like the
center of mass of a pogo stick would be.

94
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,695
Not only can you see it with your eye,
but we were able to measure

95
00:08:10,695 --> 00:08:16,293
the same sorts of energetic traces
of the spring loaded inverted

96
00:08:16,293 --> 00:08:21,178
pendulum in the mass center
of the body of this machine.

97
00:08:21,178 --> 00:08:27,064
But also, we're able to show that
some of the more detailed states,

98
00:08:27,064 --> 00:08:32,036
some of the leg configurations
that we've talked about in

99
00:08:32,036 --> 00:08:37,718
the kinematics section,
also conformed to the time trajectories

100
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:42,298
that one would expect to see
in a slip like situation.

101
00:08:42,298 --> 00:08:47,171
And so, what we found was that
properly tuned means the clock had to

102
00:08:47,171 --> 00:08:51,538
be set properly,
I'll talk about the clock very shortly.

103
00:08:51,538 --> 00:08:56,089
And the leg compliances, the springinesses
of the legs, needed to be tuned very,

104
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:57,630
very carefully.

105
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,560
They're anisotropic, means that
they're very directionally different.

106
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,600
They're stiff in one direction and they're
very compliant in other directions.

107
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,650
These compliances and

108
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:13,620
the timings of the feet for clock
needed to be tuned up very carefully.

109
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,640
And when they were,
then the RHex empirically could be seen to

110
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,230
anchor this spring loaded inverted
pendulum pogo stick template,

111
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,140
just as the animals do when they run.

112
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,430
We are very excited about that and the
question was, could we understand it and

113
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,500
could we control it?

114
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,500
How would we understand how to tune these
various complicated aspects of the body

115
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,420
of the machine, in order that it could
anchor this very useful running template.

116
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:49,360
Well, we developed a number of
mathematical approaches to this problem.

117
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,050
The first and most straightforward was
assuming that we could sense every part,

118
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:59,080
every state of the body, every aspect of
the body and every part of the leg, and

119
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,540
the contact properties of the legs.

120
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:06,030
We did that in a family of
mathematical models and simulations,

121
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:10,069
the most important of which and
the simplest of which was a series of

122
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,140
bipedal spring loaded inverted pendulum
templates produced by my then student,

123
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:22,280
now Professor Uluc Saranli at
Middle Eastern Technical University.

124
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:30,010
What Uluc did was he took the alternating
tripod gait of this machine,

125
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:37,430
which I'll now describe and
he virtualized that as a biped.

126
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:41,880
Alternating tripod is the name of
a gait that hexapedal animals,

127
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:49,020
insects principally, are almost always
exhibiting when they run at any speed.

128
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:55,150
Alternating tripod means that the two
left, the two legs in the front and

129
00:10:55,150 --> 00:11:00,720
the rear of one side and the middle leg
of the other side are in phase whilst,

130
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,510
the two legs of the in phase side,
front and

131
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,770
rear, are out of phase and
raised up in the air.

132
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,960
And the other leg on the two legged
down side is up in the air as well.

133
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,198
So it's two sets of three
legs in alternation.

134
00:11:19,198 --> 00:11:24,122
And so these three legs,
two on one side in front and back, and

135
00:11:24,122 --> 00:11:29,638
one on the other side in the middle
are acting as a virtual single leg.

136
00:11:29,638 --> 00:11:33,498
And so they're two virtual single legs and
so this is a virtual biped.

137
00:11:33,498 --> 00:11:38,290
When the animals run they're
running virtually bipedally even

138
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,138
though their support base is larger.

139
00:11:41,138 --> 00:11:46,439
We understood that these
complicated bodies with their

140
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:52,198
24-degree of freedoms in the legs and
the body combined.

141
00:11:52,198 --> 00:11:57,119
And there are very few number of
actuators would have to be organized

142
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:59,680
in a very careful way.

143
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,470
There are many many kinematic
singularities in the RHex design.

144
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,840
Particularly when the legs
are all coming down in parallel.

145
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,750
If we focus on this
alternating tripod gait,

146
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:16,990
which is a ubiquitous bipedal trot in
animals, virtual bipedal trot in animals.

147
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,754
Then, we motivate
a bipedal approximation or

148
00:12:20,754 --> 00:12:26,159
a bipedal projection of the RHex
machine onto this figure that Uluc

149
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:31,854
drew which was a virtual bipedal
spring-loaded inverted pendulum,

150
00:12:31,854 --> 00:12:37,063
in that each of these two legs was
its own pogo stick to the body and

151
00:12:37,063 --> 00:12:39,308
they would be alternated.

152
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:44,532
If we introduce the stance control very,
very actively,

153
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:50,291
where we use the shank springiness,
and the touchdown angle and

154
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:56,708
the liftoff angle, and we think of
being able to control these things.

155
00:12:56,708 --> 00:13:01,410
Then, we can actually decouple all these
complicated pogo stick dynamics and

156
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,630
achieve a control of this template.

157
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:10,040
There were other interesting
control features of this actively

158
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,200
anchored mechanism which I
will not trouble you with, but

159
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,110
they were important to
the success of the simulation.

160
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:26,580
The anchoring control then, was based
upon a quasi-static selection of stands.

161
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,430
Let me explain that in a figure.

162
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:34,910
Here you see a sagittal plane view of the
RHex, of the physical bodied RHex machine,

163
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:41,050
wherein there's a virtual
tow sketched in the figure.

164
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:48,350
That's achieved by tinting the physical
toes in just the right manner so that,

165
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:55,420
the mass center of the physical body
meets the ground through a virtual line.

166
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:04,740
That's at the point of a maximum
pressure point of the leg support,

167
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,590
in such a fashion that it feels
to the machine as though there's

168
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:14,130
really one single virtual leg,
whose angle can now be adjusted.

169
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:18,656
The touch down angle can now be adjusted
in the virtual leg by adjusting

170
00:14:18,656 --> 00:14:20,968
the cant of the true physical legs.

171
00:14:24,068 --> 00:14:28,890
The limits on the hip torques were very,
very important.

172
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:36,410
And, we were not able to
maintain stance in the simulation

173
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:40,440
without violating the very
limited hip torques.

174
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,770
And so we threw away the physical limits
on the torques in order to achieve

175
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,940
the stance phase.

176
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,250
This has to do with the problems of
traction that I described earlier in

177
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,620
the first segment,
when we talked about the cheetah and

178
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,240
it's claws, and how the cheetah
is using its claws to dig in.

179
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,320
If we don't have enough torque, then we
can't dig into the ground with our normal

180
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,990
forces enough to get traction reaction
forces to keep from slipping.

181
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,868
Or from a toe popping off the ground.

182
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:13,933
When we made all these
physical approximations and

183
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:17,628
relaxed some of these
physical constraints.

184
00:15:17,628 --> 00:15:22,990
We were able to show
mathematically that this sagittal

185
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:27,771
plane view of the machine
actually did stabilize

186
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:32,448
an embedded spring loaded
inverted pendulum.

187
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:38,118
And we could then take that projection and
use our understanding

188
00:15:38,118 --> 00:15:43,473
of the larger kinematics of
the machine to generalize across

189
00:15:43,473 --> 00:15:49,048
the sagittal plane into the full
six-degree of freedom body.

190
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:53,056
So that you now see a simulation
of Uluc's anchoring,

191
00:15:53,056 --> 00:15:58,723
actively anchored control of the spring
inverted pendulum in a simulation of

192
00:15:58,723 --> 00:16:03,886
the true physical six-degree of
freedom in the body of RHex machine.
