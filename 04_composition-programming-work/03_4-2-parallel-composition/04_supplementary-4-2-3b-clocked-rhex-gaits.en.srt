1
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:04,327
Well, simulations are great.

2
00:00:04,327 --> 00:00:07,606
One of my former students,
now professor Lewis [INAUDIBLE] at

3
00:00:07,606 --> 00:00:11,980
John's Hopkins University was want to
say simulations are doomed to succeed.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,930
[LAUGH] Because we always
throw away a lot of

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:21,270
the physical detail and we needed to throw
away a lot of the physical detail in order

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,790
to get these controls which are very
aggressive to work properly.

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,170
The chief reason that these controls
couldn't be brought into the physical

8
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,660
world was because
the sensing of the legs and

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,150
the contact properties of the legs
turned out to be very, very difficult.

10
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,370
Let's talk about that problem.

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,540
Well, why couldn't we bring this

12
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,850
actively controlled machine
into the physical world?

13
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,702
Principally, because we couldn't get, and

14
00:00:50,702 --> 00:00:55,543
probably still are not able
with technology of 2015,

15
00:00:55,543 --> 00:01:00,479
to get good feedback from the legs
up into the body in a manner

16
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,517
which is both accurate enough,
and timely enough to achieve

17
00:01:05,517 --> 00:01:10,291
these very aggressive high
gain feedback control loss.

18
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:14,906
Before we talk about that in detail, let's
observe that Robert Full, my biologist

19
00:01:14,906 --> 00:01:19,456
collaborator at Berkley, together with
his doctoral student, Devin Jindrich,

20
00:01:19,456 --> 00:01:23,293
who is now at Arizona State University
as a professor in his own right.

21
00:01:23,293 --> 00:01:28,291
Had shown about two years
earlier that the cockroaches,

22
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:33,820
when they run, are also not able
to use their distal feedback.

23
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,120
It turns out that Bob and

24
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,900
Devin put miniaturized canons on
the backs of cockroaches and they

25
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,990
fire those canons while the cockroaches
are running to impart a huge impulse.

26
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,740
To perturb the gate and it turned out
that the animals recovered their gait so

27
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,129
quickly that it was too quick for
the travel time of a neural

28
00:01:58,129 --> 00:02:03,950
signal from the point of sensing through
the synapse to the point of control.

29
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,723
So the cockroach itself
is stabilizing its body.

30
00:02:09,723 --> 00:02:15,734
First of all, in a mechanical only or
preflexive manner.

31
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:18,090
No neural signals involved.

32
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:24,600
The RHex leg contact detection
problem is at least as hard and

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,460
harder probably for us than
the cockroach distal feedback problem,

34
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,450
because the RHex legs are free to rotate.

35
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:37,820
And so, it's very difficult to
get a signal across the gap

36
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,700
between the motor and
the stator of those rotating legs.

37
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:48,314
My doctoral student, Professor Patron Lin,

38
00:02:48,314 --> 00:02:54,264
now at National Taiwan University,
was able to achieve a actively

39
00:02:54,264 --> 00:02:59,578
fed back leg contact sensor
using a wireless system that was

40
00:02:59,578 --> 00:03:05,040
designed by different doctoral student,
Doctor.

41
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,220
And they were able to get signals but
the signals were quite noisy.

42
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:16,010
Instead subsequently,
numbers of students have tried to build

43
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:21,460
virtual leg contact
sensors based upon some

44
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,909
surrogate signal that's picked up when the
leg hits the ground or hits some solid.

45
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,070
Unfortunately, these methods
are either inaccurate or they're slow.

46
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:38,690
Inaccurate or flawed because we might

47
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:45,350
use the tracking error when the leg
hits the ground and feels a load and

48
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:50,080
begins to lose its tracking, as was
explained in the tracking control segment.

49
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:58,960
The difficulty there is it's very, very
hard to know when your tracking error is

50
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,630
a consequence of the leg touch down or a
consequence of the lagging leg in the air.

51
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,240
Alternatively, Dr.
Aaron Johnson subsequently

52
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,880
was able to build a model of
the recirculating leg and

53
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,600
use that model to detect
residual estimation errors.

54
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,620
And when those estimation
errors went high,

55
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,161
that was a very accurate indication
that the contact had been made.

56
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:29,786
But unfortunately,
the extra sensing loops introduced

57
00:04:29,786 --> 00:04:35,180
sufficient lag that the stance phase
was over by the time the signal

58
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:40,299
processing finished and
the contact detection had been made.

59
00:04:41,808 --> 00:04:46,858
So we never ever were
able to get very fast and

60
00:04:46,858 --> 00:04:55,070
very accurate distal feedback from
the legs up into the clock control.

61
00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:00,050
Thus, for many, many, many years,
the control of the RHex gaits has been

62
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,990
a feed forward clock-excited signal
that I will now describe to you.

63
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:14,060
If you watch this movie, you will see that
there are two virtual hands on this clock.

64
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,780
One hand is moving quickly, and
the other hand is moving slowly.

65
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,000
And then when that fast hand comes down
to the bottom, it changes speed and

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,780
it moves slowly whilst the other
hand moves around quickly.

67
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:32,578
These hands are virtual
spokes of a virtual wheel.

68
00:05:32,578 --> 00:05:38,630
In fact, they're two virtual
out of phase wheels and

69
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,810
when one spoke is on the ground,

70
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,200
the other spoke of the virtual wheel
on the other side is rotating quickly

71
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,100
to come down to touchdown just in time for
the other leg to lift off.

72
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,280
This is the clock that we've
always called the Buehler Clock

73
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,070
in honor of Martin Buehler,
who first devised it.

74
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:04,830
This is the feed forward clock excitation
signal that I have been discussing so far.

75
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,897
What can we say about
a clock excited hopper?

76
00:06:08,897 --> 00:06:13,211
Well Dr. Komsuoglu,
whose name I mentioned to you before,

77
00:06:13,211 --> 00:06:17,779
succeeded in showing that a clock
excited vertical hopper could

78
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:22,281
indeed be stabilized successfully
by a properly tuned clock.

79
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,616
And this analytical result meant
that the tuning of the clock and

80
00:06:25,616 --> 00:06:29,520
the tuning of the compliance could be
done mathematically at design time.

81
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,790
What happens when we increase
the degrees of freedom?

82
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:40,420
Let's go from a simple one degree of
freedom vertical hopper to something like

83
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,991
a clock excited two degree of freedom
spring-loaded inverted pendulum.

84
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,970
Here if the clock

85
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:52,210
has the effect forcing the leg to touch
down at the same angle each time.

86
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,430
Then, we were able to do an analysis
with my colleague and collaborator,

87
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,915
Professor Phil Holmes at Princeton and
his graduate student, Rafael Ghigliazza.

88
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:08,396
And we were able to come up with good
sufficient and necessary conditions for

89
00:07:08,396 --> 00:07:12,480
stabilizing this slip template
in this clocked hopper.

90
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,218
Unfortunately, when we moved to
the next degree of freedom when we

91
00:07:16,218 --> 00:07:20,758
added a body attitude and tried to account
for the three degree of freedom clocked

92
00:07:20,758 --> 00:07:23,780
spring loaded and
inverted pendulum with attitude.

93
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,664
We were only be able to get very loose,
sufficient and very,

94
00:07:26,664 --> 00:07:29,963
very loose necessary conditions for
stability.

95
00:07:29,963 --> 00:07:35,400
And so
to this day the control of the anchoring

96
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,990
of the pogo stick, or
the spring loaded inverted pendulum,

97
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,910
in the physical RHex is
an unfinished bit of analysis.

98
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:50,070
And to this day, we're missing
complete clock anchoring conditions so

99
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:55,460
that we don't know how to tune
the machine properly at design time and

100
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:00,172
we're forced to tune the machine
empirically at run time.

101
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,327
Let's describe that process.

102
00:08:05,644 --> 00:08:10,553
Tuning Task Open Loop Gaits is not so
hard if you take

103
00:08:10,553 --> 00:08:16,210
the vantage point of
a simple learning mechanism.

104
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:20,960
So, we will fallback on an empirical

105
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,990
tuning method which is a very,
very simple form of learning.

106
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:31,750
Which uses a gradient descent in
the parameter space of the clock to

107
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:36,990
try to improve a cost function that robot
measures again, and again, and again.

108
00:08:38,595 --> 00:08:42,305
The natural cost function to use
is the specific resistance, and

109
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:46,785
the robot can measure its own specific
resistance instantaneously if you take

110
00:08:46,785 --> 00:08:51,765
the power divided by speed
version of specific resistance.

111
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:56,483
Go back to the first segment
1.1.1 if you forgotten about what

112
00:08:56,483 --> 00:08:58,936
we meant by specific resistance.

113
00:08:58,936 --> 00:09:03,738
If we use specific resistance or
a modified version

114
00:09:03,738 --> 00:09:09,099
thereof as the cost function,
we can measure our time and

115
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:16,146
measure the battery power used to
achieve a traversal of a known distance.

116
00:09:16,146 --> 00:09:22,559
And by measuring the time against the
distance and using the power consumed for

117
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:28,820
that leg, we achieve an estimate of
the specific resistance for that gait.

118
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:36,130
And so what this robot would do,
it would autonomously run ten meters.

119
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,690
Turn itself around by
watching the end stop.

120
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,230
Start its clock,
run again with a different gait.

121
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,230
Come to the end,
evaluate a specific resistance.

122
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,934
Turn around, choose a different
set of gait parameters that would

123
00:09:50,934 --> 00:09:55,470
lower where it predicted would
lower the cost in the next gait and

124
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,243
repeat again, and again, and again.

125
00:09:58,243 --> 00:10:01,126
Let me give you some feeling for
what this is like empirically.

126
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:05,576
So here is an early trial
where the robot was

127
00:10:05,576 --> 00:10:10,540
running at about 40
centimeters per second.

128
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:15,814
And as it tuned itself around,
you can see the gait parameters changing

129
00:10:15,814 --> 00:10:20,500
in the slides, and you can see from the
movie that the gaits begin to be faster,

130
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:28,496
and faster yet
without much energetic cost.

131
00:10:28,496 --> 00:10:36,330
Until finally, we achieved empirically
gaits that looked like this.

132
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,838
Here's an example of
a reasonably fast RHex gait.

133
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:47,006
This is RHex running across mixed
terrain at five body lengths per second,

134
00:10:47,006 --> 00:10:54,532
unheard of for a machine at that point,
legged machine at that point.

135
00:10:54,532 --> 00:10:57,101
And this was result of this very, very,

136
00:10:57,101 --> 00:11:01,563
very simple learning method whose
descent its specific resistance as

137
00:11:01,563 --> 00:11:06,419
a function of iteration is depicted in
the graph next to this running movie.

138
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:14,244
This is much as we understand about RHex.

139
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:21,250
Analytically, we're constantly interested
in improving our understanding

140
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:27,240
mathematically, and we're constantly
attempting to achieve better feedback,

141
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,220
more accurate feedback, and
faster feedback from the legs to the body.

142
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:38,120
And in large measure, this has motivated
some recent developments in the lab

143
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,530
that we'll be discussing in the next
two segments bearing on parallel

144
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:47,269
composition of a much more aggressive and
analytically successful and

145
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:51,020
empirically successful kind.

146
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,495
Stay tuned.
