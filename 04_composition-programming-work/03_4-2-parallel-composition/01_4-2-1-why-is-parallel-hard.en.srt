1
00:00:05,497 --> 00:00:09,280
We had a brief introduction to
parallel composition last segment.

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,720
In this segment,
we're going to talk about details.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,470
We'll push on a synthetic
view of parallel composition.

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,530
That is as roboticists we want to
construct behaviors using compositions and

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,790
we'll talk about how we accomplish that.

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,300
And we'll place a special emphasis
on behavioral modularity and

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,270
I'll explain what that is.

8
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,543
Jeff talked about
templates in section 2.1.

9
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:34,274
Just to quickly recap.

10
00:00:34,274 --> 00:00:38,102
Templates are low dimensional
reference dynamics.

11
00:00:38,102 --> 00:00:42,439
In this picture you can see how
we use the idea of templates and

12
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:45,430
anchors to analyze biological systems.

13
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,060
A complicated system sometimes behaves
like it's actually a simpler one and

14
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,640
the template captures
the underlying simpler dynamics.

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,480
This idea is later used to
analyze machines like Rex

16
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,920
as Dan said in section 4.1.

17
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,450
Instead of the bodycentric
view of templates and anchors,

18
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,450
what about a more dynamical systems view?

19
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:13,140
In this cartoon, the blue line
indicates the template dynamics.

20
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,210
That is they're actually
lower dimensional and

21
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,810
simpler than the full state
space which is in grey.

22
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,610
The actual evolution of the system might
follow something like the red arrows where

23
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:26,980
the attraction down to the template sub
manifold is called the anchoring dynamics.

24
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,530
Somewhat surprisingly, anchoring is
actually a parallel composition.

25
00:01:32,082 --> 00:01:35,930
Here is my template dynamics,
the blue again and

26
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,190
the anchor dynamics is simply a parallel
composition of something that attracts

27
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,778
down to the template sub manifold.

28
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,250
With them together, you get something
like the picture on the left again.

29
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,260
To summarize, for systems with
a high number of degrees of freedom,

30
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:54,170
there's really no alternative to
thinking about parallel composition.

31
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,410
Why is this?

32
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:59,110
It's because uncoordinated degrees
of freedom in a mechanical systems

33
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:03,110
tend to accumulate energy and
that usually causes the robot to fail.

34
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,660
What happens in lots of animals and

35
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,500
robots is that these extra degrees of
freedom might be passively controlled?

36
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:14,120
In this situation, they're actually
referred to as something called preflexes.

37
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,020
So either you have preflexes or

38
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,490
you can think about parallel
compositions of templates.

39
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,310
One of the difficulties of
parallel composition is coupling.

40
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,900
To illustrate this, look at this circuit.

41
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,270
There are two physical parts of
the circuit if you look carefully.

42
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:35,190
An RL circuit over here and
an RC circuit over on the right.

43
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,180
These two separate parts
are connected by the resistor R21.

44
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,780
Let's think about the limit
if R21 goes to infinity.

45
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,680
That would physically
disconnect the circuit and

46
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,273
the current in the RL part would not
interfere with the current in the RC part.

47
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,900
This is a physical decoupling.

48
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:56,370
And the solutions of the RL part and
the RC part would not interact.

49
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,560
You could say that the evolution of the
system can be represented by this diagonal

50
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,270
linear system or
x1 dot is not affect by x2 and vice versa.

51
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,650
Here's some images of what happens when

52
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:14,610
you don't have the coupling which are
the arrows in blue and you start slowly

53
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,270
adding coupling by reducing R21
from its initial value of infinity.

54
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,950
You get something like the red lines,

55
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,870
which are slight deformations
of the blue lines.

56
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,590
And if you keep increasing the coupling,
you get higher deformations, but

57
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,420
you can see how it still resembles
the original decoupled system somewhat.

58
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,650
Crosstalk can be much worse
in mechanical systems.

59
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,170
Let's think of a simple system
like a double pendulum.

60
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,690
Which you can think about as a parallel
composition of an upper link and

61
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:49,070
a lower link, where the controller is just
gravity and there's some natural damping.

62
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:52,842
So if I held one of the links
of the double pendulum rigid,

63
00:03:52,842 --> 00:03:57,181
you'd imagine that it would
oscillate until it slowly died out.

64
00:03:57,181 --> 00:04:00,670
So the template dynamics is
really a slow oscillation or

65
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,096
fast oscillation where
the energy is not increasing.

66
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:06,596
That is, if I release
the pendulum from some height,

67
00:04:06,596 --> 00:04:08,830
you would expect it to
not go above that height.

68
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,410
But now let's take a double pendulum.

69
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,400
You can see that even though
I started below the line,

70
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,690
one of the links ended
up crossing the line.

71
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,370
Why is this?

72
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:25,070
It's really because that the energy in
mechanical systems is coupled tightly,

73
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,520
and energy from one link can
cross over into a second one and

74
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,530
cause obstacles to be hit
where you didn't expect.

75
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,510
And here are the traces, and
you can see that even though,

76
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,730
in the right trace the height
of the system started at zero,

77
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,210
it tends to go above it and
cause failures.

78
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,210
So this kind of mechanical coupling really
messes us up when trying to do parallel

79
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,538
composition in mechanical systems.

80
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:53,920
To summarize the motivation for parallel
composition, robots have many degrees of

81
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,560
freedom and you either need to
incorporate preflexes at design time or

82
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,530
you need to think about parallel
composition of templates at control time.

83
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,420
Let's talk about this
with a simple example.

84
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:10,390
Here's a vertical hopper, and what I would
like to do as an engineer is embed this

85
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:14,400
behavior into my planer hopper, which
is a slightly more complicated system.

86
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,620
So what I'd like to do is to map my
controllers from template to anchor.

87
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,060
So that's part one of the agenda.

88
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,850
However, I would also like to embed
multiple templates, not just one.

89
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,630
For instance, my planar hopper should
not just be able to hop up and down, but

90
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,020
also move laterally on the plane.

91
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,796
To do that, we embed a second template,
the rimless wheel,

92
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:41,160
which Jeff talking about
in the previous week, and

93
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,520
have both of those controllers
acting on my planar hopper.

94
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,520
Additionally, I would like
the controllers to be decoupled.

95
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,870
I would not like to have to worry
about the fore-aft control, and

96
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,970
the vertical hop control, and vice versa.

97
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:59,560
However, when anchoring multiple
templates, you have to be worried about

98
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,590
coupling forces, as we saw with the double
pendulum example in the previous slide.

99
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,590
We could either try to cancel these
coupling interactions, which remember get

100
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:13,410
worse with higher velocities since
Coriolis terms depend on velocity, but

101
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,520
then you would ruin the decouple
nature of our controller.

102
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,830
We'll talk in the next segment
about how it's much preferable

103
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,670
to not have coupling
between our controllers.

104
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,640
Lastly, I've just talked
about the implementation.

105
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,230
But that's not really enough.

106
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:31,460
You have to be able to verify that
our parallel composition works

107
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,928
both in practice as well as analytically.

108
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:37,570
Now that I've explained
some of the difficulties,

109
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,630
let see some empirical
parallel compositions.

110
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,730
Raibert was one of the first
to pioneer on this.

111
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,560
Here's a video of a Raibert
hopper hopping up and down.

112
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,450
And this is using the controller that
Jeff described in the previous weeks.

113
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,320
What Raibert did, was he took
this vertical hopping idea, and

114
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,450
added a decoupled controller for
fore aft movement.

115
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:03,999
And you can see here, hopper is happily
hopping along the boom at control speeds.

116
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,779
It seems like the implementation
was very simple but

117
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:12,684
there are some considerations
that might not be so obvious.

118
00:07:12,684 --> 00:07:17,016
The ratio of the leg inertia to the body
inertias turns out to be very important to

119
00:07:17,016 --> 00:07:19,872
the decoupled controllers
to work in this example.

120
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:24,280
For Raibert this ratio was 14:1 for
the body to the leg inertia.

121
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,260
I've made a simulation here where
this ratio is actually changeable.

122
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,710
Here it's hopping fine for a ratio of 7:1.

123
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:37,320
But then if you keep increasing it so that
it's about 1:1, it doesn't work anymore.

124
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:43,930
So there's an interesting
interaction of design choices

125
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,650
with the ability to implement
decoupled controllers.

126
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:50,190
To summarize, in a high degree of freedom
robot, there's no alternative to either

127
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,070
incorporating preflexes or thinking
about parallel composition of templates.

128
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,490
Coupling forces in mechanical systems will
really try to screw us up when we try to

129
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:04,490
implement decoupled controllers but it's
really preferrable to be able to do this

130
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:09,490
for a number of reasons, which are going
to be more obvious in the coming lectures.

131
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:14,080
Lastly verifying that the parallel
composition is correct is difficult, but

132
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,940
it's also very important.

133
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,711
And we're going to talk about
that in the next segment.
