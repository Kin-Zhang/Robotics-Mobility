00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,885
Welcome to week four,
the last installment of our robotics MOOC.

3
00:00:26,325 --> 00:00:30,525
In this week, we will bring you from what

4
00:00:30,525 --> 00:00:36,060
we understand today about composition of
behavior to the horizons of research.

5
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,280
Where we can begin to achieve behaviors
that we imperfectly understand but

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,570
have some hope of understanding
well enough to become truly

7
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,460
compositional as if we have
a language of programing work.

8
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:59,570
In the first segment,
we'll be thinking about the abstract idea

9
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:05,650
of dynamical composition, we'll come back
to this ideas of sequential uncomposition,

10
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,680
sequential and
parallel composition that were introduced

11
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,600
in the very original first week and we'll
treat them a little bit more carefully

12
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,300
both from the point of view of
mathematics and of energetic design.

13
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:29,640
Here's an example of a RHex like hexapod
seen from the side and the sagittal plane,

14
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,730
kinematically behaving just as if
it were the pogo stick on the left.

15
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,850
And here's an instantiated version
of RHex in the physical world,

16
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,150
running through the grass.

17
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,630
Acting on the grass just
as if it were a pogo stick,

18
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,630
even though it doesn't
look anything like one.

19
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,600
You can see in slow motion
when RHex is properly tuned,

20
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,590
it does begin to look like a pogo stick
from the point of view of its mass center.

21
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,160
We'll be talking about
these ideas of anchoring

22
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,015
the templates in the bodies in 4.1.

23
00:02:07,015 --> 00:02:10,900
In 4.2, we'll introduce you to

24
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,500
a family of compositions that we have
been practicing for a while, but

25
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:22,080
only recently do we begin to think we have
the mathematics to underlie them formally.

26
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,820
We'll start by talking about why
parallel composition is hard.

27
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,240
We'll then discuss the minotaur
robot that you've seen before and

28
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,000
the jerboa robot that you've seen before.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,640
As increasingly complicated
compositions of simple pieces.

30
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,530
You remember the Ray Bird
hopper from before, and

31
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,240
you remember the rimless
wheel from before.

32
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:50,186
We're going to put these two together
to build a two dimensional hopper, and

33
00:02:50,186 --> 00:02:54,977
then we're going to put them together
with that inertial tail reorienting

34
00:02:54,977 --> 00:02:59,157
style behavior that we showed
you earlier to get the minotaur.

35
00:03:01,386 --> 00:03:04,470
We're going to do the same thing to
the more complicated jerboa body.

36
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:09,420
And we can begin to get mathematical
proofs of the empirical behaviors that you

37
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,370
see revealed in these videos.

38
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,490
The last segment of this course will bring
you to the horizons of research of what we

39
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,130
understand.

40
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:24,370
Here, we actually get the minotaur
to bound around in a stable manner

41
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,630
using simple compositions
of vertical Ray Bird

42
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:35,790
style hoppers in ways that we can
almost begin to prove are correct.

43
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,699
We can use the same compositions
in different bodies.

44
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,020
We can use different
compositions in the same body.

45
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:51,310
The last piece of this week
will be spent thinking about

46
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,250
the jagged edge of what we understand,

47
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,590
which are these transitional behaviors
such as Aaron Johnson's leaping Rhex.

48
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:05,760
And Aaron Johnson's scrambling Rhex, where
you can see if we could get this down

49
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,290
right, we would be able to hugely
increase the operating capacity and

50
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,030
the rescue abilities
of machines like Rhex.

51
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:19,555
Welcome to the final installment of our
mobility component of this robotics MOOC.

52
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:25,360
In this week four of the mobility effort,

53
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,330
we will be talking about
the beginnings of programing.

54
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:34,000
What we do and don't understand, and
what sorts of behaviors we can get

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,410
in the physical world with what
sorts of mathematical guarantees.
