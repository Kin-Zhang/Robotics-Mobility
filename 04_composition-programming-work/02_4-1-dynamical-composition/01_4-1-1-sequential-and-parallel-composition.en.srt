00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,598
In week one,
Dan talked to you about basins and energy.

2
00:00:07,598 --> 00:00:11,930
Remember that gradient-like
systems like to flow downhill.

3
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,980
So what does this hill mean?

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,740
For a passive mechanical system, this hill
could just be the total mechanical energy

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,830
of the system, which doesn't increase,
but decreases because of friction or

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,830
other actuated control inputs.

7
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,070
Here I;ve have drawn a cartoon
of a hill might look like.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,540
So, the actual state of the system
is down below on the plane and

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:37,590
the hill signifies how the states
kind of roll down the hill.

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,010
The basin is the rim of the funnel which
is all the states that are kind of

11
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:47,200
funneled through into the goal location,
but what if now we have multiple funnels?

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,060
So instead of just rolling down one,
we could have the states

13
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,780
roll down one funnel, then into a second
one, and then into a third one, etcetera.

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,425
This simple cartoon is really the idea
behind sequential composition, or

15
00:00:59,425 --> 00:01:01,470
back-chaining basins.

16
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:06,240
The only rule, really, is that
the goal location of the first funnel

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,420
has to be within the basin
of the second funnel.

18
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,290
That's it, it's very simple and intuitive,
but it's been used a lot in robotics.

19
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,581
Here's an example of a juggling robot,
where this idea was used to transition

20
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:21,794
between bouncing the ball and
palming the ball to make it stop.

21
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,120
This is not the only use
of sequential composition.

22
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:34,120
Way back in 1984, a famous paper by
Lozano, Perez, Mason, and Taylor

23
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,790
described how sequential composition might
be used to automate factory floor tasks.

24
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:46,770
This is a peg in hole assembly task ,where
for instance, in the center right image,

25
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,480
a successful assembly might
entail moving the peg down,

26
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,250
sliding it across to the left,
and then down into the hole.

27
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,680
This strategy, it'll be obvious to you,
doesn't work for the center image, for

28
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,030
instance.

29
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,490
So what we're really doing is
composing a sequence of maneuvers for

30
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,990
the peg that ensure that
the assembly will proceed correctly.

31
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,450
Another assembly like example is this one,
where what we're trying to do is

32
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,310
go to a known final configuration for
these hex keys.

33
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,560
That actuated control input here is the
actuation of the tray underneath the hex

34
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,920
keys and so by tilting the trays through
a sequence of maneuvers, we can channel or

35
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,260
funnel the hex key through different
configurations into a desired final one.

36
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,530
This is also work by Matt Mason.

37
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,660
This is a more modern example
where optimization and

38
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,880
robust control ideas have come in.

39
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,420
What the researchers are doing is online
motion planning, that is they're selecting

40
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,630
appropriate funnels prepared by the
current state of this glider online and

41
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,790
using that to control it
through unknown obstacles.

42
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,390
The side effect is acute in
control objectives sequentially.

43
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,380
If we were to have
executed them in parallel,

44
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,050
that idea is called parallel composition.

45
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,200
There's going to be a lot more
about this in section 4.2,

46
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,150
but here's a quick recap of the origin and
history.

47
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,460
So let's say we build on the juggle
that I showed you two slides ago.

48
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,990
What if we wanted to now juggle
two balls instead of one?

49
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,820
So this is really a parallel
composition of the same controller.

50
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,090
But there's an interesting twist on this.

51
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:28,390
If you think about the ball-ball paddle
state space there's a big obstacle

52
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,560
if the two balls are falling
simultaneously because the paddle can't

53
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,840
hit both balls at the same time.

54
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,990
So what we're really doing is
composing the two controllers but

55
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,339
avoiding the obstacle of the phase
of the two balls being aligned.

56
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,220
Another example is
Raibert's planer hopper,

57
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,620
which Jeff talked to you about last week.

58
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,300
What Raibert did is he thought about
the vertical hopping control and

59
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,820
the forward speed control, and
the pitch control separately, and

60
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,720
played them all out together.

61
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,350
There are no similar obstacles
in this situation, but

62
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,591
that's an interesting
thing to keep in mind.

63
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,571
To summarize, robot control can be thought
of as floating downhill on artificial

64
00:04:06,571 --> 00:04:07,640
energy functions.

65
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,310
Sequential composition
formalizes a sequence of tasks

66
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,030
using back-chaning of basins.

67
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:19,360
We can sequence course manipulation or
assembly tasks and there have been several

68
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,380
other examples in the literature
that I haven't had time to cover.

69
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,630
Parallel composition describes satisfying
multiple control objectives at

70
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,380
the same time.

71
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,100
What we have to keep in mind with parallel
composition is that there are obstacles

72
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,770
introduced into the state
space that might not have been

73
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,780
there without the composition.

74
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,720
And secondly we have to keep in mind that
lots of systems inject coupling forces

75
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,920
that would either have to be cancelled or
thought about appropriately.

76
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,160
We're going to talk a lot more about
parallel composition in the next segment.
