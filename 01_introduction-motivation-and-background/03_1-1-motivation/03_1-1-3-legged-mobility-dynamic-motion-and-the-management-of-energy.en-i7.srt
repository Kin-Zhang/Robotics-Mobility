1
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:12,200
Well, we are going to be focusing,
particularly, on legged mobility.

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,643
And legged mobility brings us
to an understanding of and

3
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:21,190
engagement with dynamics and
the management of energy.

4
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,330
Why focus on legs?

5
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:30,120
Well, we're humans and we're particularly
interested in human animals.

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,650
And humans live and work largely on land.

7
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,020
Look at this very, very interesting map

8
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,400
produced about 20 years ago by
some economists at Harvard.

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,113
They show you the density
of the navigable and

10
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:51,952
temperate earth ecozones
which comprise only

11
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:56,552
8% of the inhabitable landmass on earth.

12
00:00:56,552 --> 00:00:59,566
But this 8% accounts for

13
00:00:59,566 --> 00:01:04,366
50% of the world's economic output.

14
00:01:04,366 --> 00:01:10,920
And so we see that despite our wonderful
legs and our wonderful mobility,

15
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,474
the largest component of human living and
working is happening on a tiny,

16
00:01:17,474 --> 00:01:22,050
tiny substrate,
8% of the inhabited landmass.

17
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:27,338
And we suspect, as the economists predict,
that as human beings come to

18
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:33,424
be able to exploit more of this inhabited
land mass with greater mobility engines.

19
00:01:33,424 --> 00:01:38,184
That there will be much,
much greater economic output in presently

20
00:01:38,184 --> 00:01:42,701
underserved and economically
deprived regions of the planet.

21
00:01:44,663 --> 00:01:49,417
We're also interested in legs because
there are a variety of inhospitable

22
00:01:49,417 --> 00:01:54,630
environments where people can't go, or
shouldn't go, that legs are crucial.

23
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:01,279
For example, about ten years ago, there
was a terrible disaster at Sago Mine.

24
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,450
And it was clear from the news reports and

25
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:14,300
careful formal studies of the accident
site that if we'd had better robots

26
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,860
that were more mobile, more easily
able to traverse these very non level.

27
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,040
No roads here, no flat fields here.

28
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,770
If we had robots that were able to
traverse these very difficult, broken,

29
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:34,480
unstable land regimes, we possibly could
have done better by the disaster victims.

30
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,560
Not just on Earth are we interested
in terrestrial mobility,

31
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,430
there's extraterrestrial mobility.

32
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:47,400
It's not that you can't roam
around Mars with wheels.

33
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,390
The amazing Mars Rovers have way, way,

34
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:56,130
way outlived their planned life, but
they were limited in their mobility.

35
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,030
Dramatically limited by their wheels so

36
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,460
that the Mars Rover Spirit
got stuck in the sand.

37
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:09,330
And ten years ago it died in the Martian
winter because it couldn't free itself

38
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,400
from the sand trap.

39
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,800
We think in robotics that legs
are better than wheels and

40
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,860
legs are better than tracks.

41
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,600
And legs and tails and
appendages are better than jets.

42
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,630
Why do we think that?

43
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,420
We find, when we look carefully,
that legs and

44
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:38,490
appendages enable
the mobile agent to direct

45
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:43,003
the ground reaction forces that we
talked about in the previous segment.

46
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:49,663
We can direct the ground reaction
forces and by directing them we can

47
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:54,534
choose to either leap forward,
for example,

48
00:03:54,534 --> 00:04:00,410
as Aaron Johnson's Rex Robot is
doing in this slowed down movie.

49
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,250
Or we can redirect them to jump up,

50
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,180
as Aaron Johnson's same Rex Robot
is doing in this different movie.

51
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,280
Where very,
very minute differences in the timing, and

52
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,500
the forces, and
the coordination of the leg patterns

53
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,290
give rise to dramatically
different ground reaction forces.

54
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:25,750
And those very different ground reaction
forces achieve totally different

55
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,450
kinds of mobility.

56
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:33,280
Never with a tracked or a wheeled vehicle
would one be able to achieve these sorts

57
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,640
of navigational and mobile feats
that the animals take for granted.

58
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,780
Another very, very important use for
legged mobility is

59
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,850
the possibility of feeling
the substrate through our limbs.

60
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:56,220
This is called proprioception, and this
movie of Rex trudging its way up a slope.

61
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,970
We want the machine to stop midway and
park itself in such a fashion

62
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:09,010
that it doesn't, any longer, need to exert
any current, any torque against the world.

63
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,110
So that it could stay there for
a long time without burning up energy.

64
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:19,390
To do so it must feel the forces of
the ground through its legs, in its hip.

65
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:23,169
And by feeling them, it can balance and
achieve an efficient stand.

66
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:30,588
So in this course we will be spending
most of our time on legged mobility and

67
00:05:30,588 --> 00:05:35,095
all of our time on appendaged mobility,
tails and legs.

68
00:05:35,095 --> 00:05:41,145
As soon as we say that,
we're bound to consider the fundamental

69
00:05:41,145 --> 00:05:47,656
physical properties before we take
on any further considerations.

70
00:05:47,656 --> 00:05:50,233
Mobility starts with physics.

71
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:55,794
Mobility starts with Newton, F = ma.

72
00:05:55,794 --> 00:06:01,294
Mobility requires
an understanding of Lagrange's

73
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:06,544
reformulation of Newton's
laws into a principle

74
00:06:06,544 --> 00:06:11,919
of least action that gave
him a mechanics that began

75
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,730
to seem more geometric and
less analytical.

76
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:21,080
We will visit Lagrange's
reformulation of Newton's laws and

77
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,429
we will make major use of his ideas.

78
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,000
Most importantly, Hamilton came along and

79
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,950
understood that these least action
principles could be again reconceived in

80
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:43,250
terms of conservation principles,
energy conservation, energy loss.

81
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:48,480
In this course,
we're concerned with losing energy,

82
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,990
we don't want to conserve energy.

83
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:54,250
We want to expend the joules
in our batteries and

84
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:59,550
get those joules into the body in
the form of kinetic energy of the body,

85
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,200
so that the body can move around and
get things done for the robot.

86
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,360
In order to do so, we must waste energy,
we must spend our energy

87
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,120
on directed motion and
on thermal loss and other losses.

88
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,910
We'll be spending a lot of
time thinking about energy and

89
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,889
energy based methodologies in this course.

90
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,860
So mobility starts with physics but
it takes a very long and important detour

91
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,800
through technology, whose fundamentals
are still not completely understood.

92
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:39,370
We're very, very much concerned with
scarce resources such as specific force.

93
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,310
Specific force means force per mass, why?

94
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,290
Well, we must apply
the ground reaction forces in

95
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,630
adequate magnitude to achieve our end.

96
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,730
To do so,

97
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:58,580
with electro-mechanical actuators which
are the cleanest and the fastest acting.

98
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:04,360
We engage in the history of
recent material science and

99
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:10,530
magnetism, which is an ongoing,
slowly developing, very important area.

100
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:15,475
The progression of energetic
density in rare earth

101
00:08:15,475 --> 00:08:20,420
magnets has made a slow
change in the capacity of our

102
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:25,365
motors to impart forces
without requiring large,

103
00:08:25,365 --> 00:08:28,820
large, large rotors and stators.

104
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:33,068
And so, we show you here
a picture of an Maxon motor,

105
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:39,070
which until recently had been one of
the preferred engines of our robots.

106
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:46,010
In recent years,
itâ€™s become clear that more than just

107
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,140
the materials properties
of the motors are crucial.

108
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:55,584
We know that their ability to shed
thermal load, their ability to shed heat,

109
00:08:55,584 --> 00:09:01,028
the wasted energy that gets burned up in
joule heating in their wires is very,

110
00:09:01,028 --> 00:09:02,317
very important.

111
00:09:02,317 --> 00:09:08,121
And recently some of our colleagues,
Professor Sangbae Kim at MIT,

112
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:13,523
have pointed out that the air gap
radius when it gets enlarged for

113
00:09:13,523 --> 00:09:17,842
the same mass, gives much,
much greater torque.

114
00:09:17,842 --> 00:09:22,560
And so we should be thinking about
motors that have good rare earth magnets

115
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,360
in them and motors that have good
thermal shedding capability in them.

116
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,734
And motors that are built with large air
gap radii as shown in Sangbae's picture.

117
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:40,010
This confusion, interesting confusion,
combination of fundamental materials,

118
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:44,900
properties and technological, commercial
off the shelf availabilities is one of

119
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,260
the many wonderful confusing aspects
of robotics right now in its infancy.

120
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,510
And some day we'll get
to the bottom of it.

121
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,460
But for now,

122
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:57,570
what we know is we want greater specific
force than we can get in our machines.

123
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,940
Another scarce resource is traction.

124
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:08,650
Traction in the claws of the cheetah
that we'll come back to and

125
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,520
talk about subsequently.

126
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,720
The cheetah in the former
pictures was able to achieve its

127
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,630
huge accelerations as you saw
on those pictures because it has

128
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:26,350
claws that can engage the ground and
form virtual pin joints.

129
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:31,600
None of our robots has the ability to
recruit such huge traction forces.

130
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,580
And so, for us in the robotics world,

131
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,550
trying to achieve those accelerations
even if we had the forces

132
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,390
would cause us to be skittering over
that grass as if it were ice or Teflon.

133
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,000
Another scarce resource is power.

134
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,370
Power is the rate at which I
can move my joules around,

135
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:58,760
the rate at which energy gets
transferred from one form or another.

136
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:04,930
Another way to think about power is
the speed at which I can sustain my force.

137
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,700
Specific power, of course,
means power per mass.

138
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:14,030
And I want to get as great power per mass
as I can out of my actuator technology.

139
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:23,388
Here is an example of one our more recent
vertical climbing robots in a paper by Dr.

140
00:11:23,388 --> 00:11:28,960
Goran Lynch and Professor Clark
now at Florida State University,

141
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:35,610
Professor Pei-Chun Lin now at
National Taiwan University, and myself.

142
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:41,180
This wall running robot was achieved

143
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:46,810
by introducing compliant elements
that could absorb the energy

144
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:53,280
from the motor whilst the legs were
retracting so as to spread out

145
00:11:53,280 --> 00:12:00,490
the time over which the energy had to be
moved and avoid burning the motor coils.

146
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,740
This is another example of
a technological consideration

147
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,560
that must have formal foundations
that we don't understand yet.

148
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,630
But we will be coming back to these
considerations in the segment

149
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,000
two of the course.

150
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,980
Mobility starts with physics,
it takes a detour through technology,

151
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,070
it ends with the hope of programming work.

152
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,920
What might that mean?

153
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:36,520
As we'll see through
the hours of lectures,

154
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,880
our robots start with architectures,
the architectures of computers and

155
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,430
the architectures of motors and
the architectures of sensors.

156
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,740
There are hardware elements of various
kinds, and each of these hardware elements

157
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:56,350
has its own interesting story,
mix of technological accident and

158
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,400
fundamental material science, or
fundamental physical principles.

159
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,680
Each of these components that go into
the architecture that makes a machine

160
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,330
has its own fascinating story.

161
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:13,970
At the end, we build up our actuators and
our actuators communicate information

162
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:20,050
about the state of the environment, the
state of the body, the state of the limbs.

163
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,990
All the way back to the communicating and
coordinating structures and

164
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:25,640
the intelligence.

165
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,160
But at the end of the day, these
coordination patterns must be used to

166
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:37,120
achieve some kind of
stable energetic display,

167
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,240
some kind of stable energetic shedding.

168
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,230
And we will come to call these basins.

169
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:49,970
Basins of attraction,
places where energy wants to go low,

170
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:53,560
energy wants to get shed and
the world and the robot,

171
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,000
when they shake hands, wants to
end up in these low energy states.

172
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,150
These basins become symbols and

173
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,420
the symbols begin to be composable.

174
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,610
When we have symbols that are composable,

175
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,810
we are on the threshold
of programming languages.

176
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:19,760
And so the last week of this course
will be concerned with our ability to

177
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,390
compose these basins, these symbols,
these energy basins and

178
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:28,000
build more complicated behaviors from old.

179
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,540
For example,
if we think about a language of work, if

180
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:38,680
we think about basins as symbols,
we want to translate the abstract goals.

181
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:46,800
Move your body here, or move that dish
from this shelf into that refrigerator.

182
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,817
We want to translate these goals
into sensor-torque strategies.

183
00:14:49,817 --> 00:14:54,738
And so we want to take our
architectures as they're connected

184
00:14:54,738 --> 00:14:59,670
up to the world through our limbs and
we want to build basins.

185
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:06,560
Here's an example of Dr.
Rob Burridge's thesis from 1992,

186
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:12,100
wherein he and Al Rizzi showed
how to build a juggling basin.

187
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,910
Here the energetic design is for

188
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:19,090
an oscillating vertical
motion of the ping pong ball.

189
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:24,050
The ping pong ball wants to lie
down at that vertical motion,

190
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:27,258
and when we try to knock that ball away,

191
00:15:27,258 --> 00:15:32,334
the basin restores the ball down
to the low energy goal state.

192
00:15:34,088 --> 00:15:38,559
Here's Burridge's work on sequential
composition of those basins and

193
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:41,866
we won't talk very much
about this technically now.

194
00:15:41,866 --> 00:15:44,040
We'll do this in week four.

195
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,651
But you would like to think about
these sequential compositions as

196
00:15:48,651 --> 00:15:52,198
the beginning of a programming
language for work.

197
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,718
The virtue of formal programming
languages is that they're amenable to

198
00:15:59,718 --> 00:16:01,241
mathematical proofs.

199
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:08,562
The virtue of mathematical proofs is that
they sometimes give rise to predictable

200
00:16:08,562 --> 00:16:09,150
results.

201
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,250
It's not that the proof means
that the robot will work.

202
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,850
The proof gives you a debugging tool.

203
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:20,140
Because if the theorem is correct, and

204
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,450
the behavior does not work
in the physical world,

205
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:27,490
then you know that the hypothesis
underlying that theorem doesn't hold.

206
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,332
And it helps you in your debugging step.

207
00:16:31,332 --> 00:16:36,358
We don't like to think about robots
that don't have formal properties.

208
00:16:36,358 --> 00:16:39,287
We don't like to think about
computers that crash, but

209
00:16:39,287 --> 00:16:43,340
we're willing to live with them
if they're on our desktop.

210
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:49,530
If those computers are running our
elevator, or running our jet, or running

211
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:54,720
our search and rescue equipment, we
really, really don't want them to crash.

212
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,730
And we would like to have
formal mathematical principles

213
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,620
that preclude such possibilities.

214
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:06,790
These are the themes that we will
be covering in the weeks and

215
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,770
segments to come.

216
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:14,186
Welcome to our special mobility course
at the University of Pennsylvania,

217
00:17:14,186 --> 00:17:15,970
