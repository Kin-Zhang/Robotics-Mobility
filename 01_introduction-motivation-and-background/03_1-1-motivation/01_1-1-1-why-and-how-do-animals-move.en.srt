1
00:00:05,024 --> 00:00:07,170
Why and how do we move?

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,240
Well, we're animals.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,200
Why do animals move?

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,620
Animals, the very word means movement.

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,750
Breathing, Animalia has to
do with things that breathe.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:24,080
Aristotle, thousands of years ago,
thought about such questions and

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,250
asked why it is that animals move.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,958
And he understood that there was
some combination of reason and

9
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:34,530
motivation and perception.

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,420
And curiously, he didn't have much
to say about the motor act itself.

11
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,780
So, for thousands of years,
we've been thinking about such questions.

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,160
And recently, the biologists have
gotten together many different

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,970
fields within biology and a new discipline
of movement ecology has developed.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,200
And the movement ecologists
have come to understand that

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,500
we need to think about many
scales at the same time.

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,720
We need to think about limbs over seconds.

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,190
We need to think about
bodies over minutes.

18
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,800
We need to think about places that
the animals travel over days.

19
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:18,470
And of course over continents,
there are migrations and yearly motion.

20
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:24,399
The basic components of study involve
motion science as the engineers

21
00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:30,630
understand it, navigation as
the cognitive scientists understand it,

22
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,057
natural sciences as the physicists and
chemists participate,

23
00:01:36,057 --> 00:01:40,195
and many, many,
many branches come together.

24
00:01:40,195 --> 00:01:44,259
In our module, we're not going to so

25
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:51,030
much consider the environmental
record of travel.

26
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,224
We're not so much going to consider
the motivation and evolutionary drivers.

27
00:01:55,224 --> 00:02:01,200
We're going to focus largely on the
mechanical and navigational capabilities.

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,620
And when we think about the connections
to biology, we're trying very,

29
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,490
very hard to understand the lessons
of evolutionary ecology.

30
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:14,200
But mostly we'll be focused on what
the people in biomechanics and

31
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,590
the neuroscientists and
the cognitive scientists can tell us.

32
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:24,500
So welcome to this special
inquiry into mobility.

33
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,107
We'll be spending a lot of time
thinking about the relationship

34
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:33,981
between animal mobility and
machine mobility in the hours to come.

35
00:02:36,873 --> 00:02:38,959
Well, how do animals move?

36
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,300
It starts with Newton.

37
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,750
Newton says, F equals m a.

38
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:49,900
The body accelerates consequent
upon forces applied to it.

39
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:56,520
The forces of reaction against
the environment cause accelerations.

40
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:02,706
And those forces are carried
by appendages, limbs, tails.

41
00:03:02,706 --> 00:03:08,487
We'll be concerned with the way
in which the appendages

42
00:03:08,487 --> 00:03:13,653
of the animals or
the machines carry the forces and

43
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:19,190
imbue the body with reaction
forces from the ground.

44
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,250
This begins a very long and

45
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,610
very much unfinished story, because the
appendages have to travel with the body.

46
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,482
And so
the appendages can't be left behind, and

47
00:03:33,482 --> 00:03:35,947
if they're going to be
asserting forces and

48
00:03:35,947 --> 00:03:40,156
transmitting forces from the ground
to the body, they have to oscillate.

49
00:03:40,156 --> 00:03:44,724
If they oscillate, they have to
oscillate in tight coordination.

50
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:50,195
And tight coordination requires very
complicated and intricate feedback

51
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:55,663
loops such as the biologists are beginning
to uncover and understand, but

52
00:03:55,663 --> 00:04:00,890
we in engineering have been thinking
about for a very, very long time.

53
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,170
The feedback loops include pathways
from the environment through the limbs,

54
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:13,850
from the environment through the nerves,
within the body,

55
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:18,120
through the limbs and nerves, and
all of this pathways are mixed.

56
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,760
What's particularly fascinating to
us in robotics about animal movement

57
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:29,990
is that the animals have a lot of their
intelligence built into their bodies.

58
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:36,530
Their bodies mix form with function
in a marvelous and confusing way.

59
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,800
Muscles.

60
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,420
Muscles in the animals
sometimes function as motors,

61
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:45,920
sometimes they function as brakes,
sometimes they function as springs.

62
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,952
Intelligence.

63
00:04:48,952 --> 00:04:51,990
The intelligence is baked into the body.

64
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,700
Well, how don't the animals move?

65
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,390
And why are we spending all
of our time on the animals?

66
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,477
The animals inspire this course because
they have been moving successfully for

67
00:05:05,477 --> 00:05:07,126
hundreds of millions of years.

68
00:05:07,126 --> 00:05:11,346
Animals invented limbed mobility, and

69
00:05:11,346 --> 00:05:18,430
we would like to try to be inspired and
to learn from their mobility.

70
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:25,860
The animals are focused
on body-based sensing.

71
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,950
And traditionally, this has been less true
of the engineering artifacts in robotics,

72
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:37,220
it's very hard for
us to build sensors and actuators

73
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:41,670
all into the same body and into the limbs
that will be interacting with the world.

74
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,830
How do the animals move?

75
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,900
Well, on land, they stride.

76
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,810
How don't they move?

77
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,770
Don't they have wheels?

78
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,539
Why don't the animals have wheels?

79
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:01,220
Biology has invented wheels a few times

80
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:06,500
in the form of molecular motors and
sometimes in the form of organisms.

81
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,410
Here's a marvelous stomatopod
called the mantis shrimp.

82
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:16,140
This stomatopod was
investigated 20 years ago,

83
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,310
25 years ago by my good friend and
colleague, Bob Full and his collaborators.

84
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,940
And what they discovered was
that this animal rolls itself up

85
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,610
into a ball, really, into a disk.

86
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:34,680
And it rolls along the beach
as a disk-like wheel.

87
00:06:36,318 --> 00:06:40,376
But there are very, very,
very few animals that move in this manner.

88
00:06:40,376 --> 00:06:41,550
How about in liquid?

89
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,980
How do animals move in liquid?

90
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,670
In liquid, they slither or they swim.

91
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,560
They don't have jets?

92
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,959
Well, sure, they have jets.

93
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,740
Scientists, biologists have been
looking at squids for decades and

94
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,670
trying to understand the nature
of the jet propulsion that

95
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,030
allows the squids to
whish through the seas.

96
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,290
They think of the squids
as just hearts set free.

97
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,750
But jet propulsion turns out to be very,
very inefficient.

98
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,550
It's very inefficient to
contain the reaction mass.

99
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,480
Mostly, when animals move,
they use their limbs.

100
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,519
They use their fins, they use their legs,
they use their tails.

101
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:33,100
This course is going to be focused on the
relationship between the inspiration we

102
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,940
receive from biology and the engineering
that we can build in consequence.

103
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,590
We therefore will be
studying limbed mobility.

104
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,800
And again, when I say limbed,
I will mean all sorts of limbs,

105
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:53,280
all sorts of appendages, tails and
arms and legs and possibly even fingers.

106
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:59,159
We will be inspired, but we will not copy.

107
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:04,085
The first lessons that we learn from our
friends in biology is that the history of

108
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:06,580
animal form is very complicated.

109
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,296
Millions of years of history that
we only partially understand.

110
00:08:10,296 --> 00:08:13,430
Let's take for example tails.

111
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,420
What are tails used for?

112
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,500
Well, here's a beautiful macaque monkey.

113
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:26,340
This beautiful macaque monkey has a very
long, bushy tail, and we might be inspired

114
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:31,630
to try to build such a tail in our
robots until we talk to the biologists,

115
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:36,089
who tell us that, well, this tail is
mostly used for play-time signalling.

116
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,410
Probably we don't want our robots to
do too much play-time signalling, so

117
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:43,560
we will probably not build a tail for
this purpose.

118
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,830
How about the beaver?

119
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,680
The beaver has a tail, the beaver
uses its tail for swimming, right?

120
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,670
And we know the beaver uses its tail for
slapping and

121
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,510
warning its fellow beavers
of possible enemies.

122
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,557
These sound like very,
very useful roles for tails.

123
00:08:57,557 --> 00:09:01,185
But really, as it turns out,
when you talk to the biologists,

124
00:09:01,185 --> 00:09:03,730
the beaver's tail is used for storing fat.

125
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,660
We probably don't want to store fat in
our robots, and we probably will be very

126
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:14,390
careful about how we use insights from
the beaver tail in building our robots.

127
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,850
And then there are all the many
animals such as pigs or

128
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,110
humans that have vestigial tails.

129
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:24,790
Do we really want to build
a vestigial tail on our robots?

130
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,540
Probably not.

131
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,730
We would like to work with principles and
not appearances.

132
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,330
We have spent a lot of time
talking with Bob Full and

133
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:39,730
his students about how the lizards
use their tails to right themselves

134
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,650
in situations of crisis or imbalance.

135
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,650
And we've spent a number of years
working together with him and

136
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:52,660
his students to build tailed robots that
don't look anything like those lizards,

137
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:57,878
but have tails that function a little
bit like the lizard's in their

138
00:09:57,878 --> 00:10:03,220
self-righting ability, as seen by this
little robot car on the left hand.

139
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,460
And seen by our Rex robot
running across the pedestal

140
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,990
of Ben Franklin and righting itself with
its tail when it falls off the cliff.

141
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:18,210
These robots don't look anything like
the lizard, but the principles Involved

142
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:24,220
in getting the body level in consequence
of the tail motion is exactly

143
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:29,620
the kind of thing that we want to learn
how to do and generalize in robotics.

144
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,062
So we're concerned with bioinspiration and
not mimicry.
