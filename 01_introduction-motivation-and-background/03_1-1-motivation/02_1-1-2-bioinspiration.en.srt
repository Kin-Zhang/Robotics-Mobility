1
00:00:05,142 --> 00:00:06,800
Bio-inspiration.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,630
Wait a minute!

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,300
Don't machines already move better?

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,070
Machines, they're great.

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,380
We've been building machines for
hundreds of years.

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:22,840
We have the fastest machine that's
ever traveled, we have Helios 2.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,090
NASA built Helios 2 to
study solar properties.

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,425
And Helios 2 in its fastest ascent
toward the Sun reached a speed of

9
00:00:32,425 --> 00:00:39,008
0.22 kilometers per second, which is
fractionally like the speed of light.

10
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:43,663
The speed of light is faster than
anything in the universe can travel.

11
00:00:43,663 --> 00:00:49,400
We have faster machines than anything
that biology has come up with.

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,360
And how about capacity?

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,830
Our machines have far greater loads
than any animal could possibly bear.

14
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:04,230
Our largest cargo ship, the MSC Oscar,
carries 200,000 cubic meters of space.

15
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,140
And you can see how it dwarfs
the human being in the picture here.

16
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:16,590
But if we move away from mere speed,
and mere load,

17
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,280
and mere speed overload and
study a little bit more carefully.

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,800
We begin to see that the animals
are marvelously better sources of

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,830
mobility than anything we've yet
been able to come up with in engineering.

20
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,560
I'm plotting a graph that my colleague,
Professor Art Kuo at University of

21
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:42,120
Michigan has added to, where he displays
the cost of transport which you could

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,500
think about as miles per gallon really
in this chart, it's gallons per mile.

23
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,000
And the way you'd like
to start thinking about

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,910
cost of transport is a notion
called specific resistance.

25
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:59,810
Specific resistance measures
the energy expended

26
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,080
to achieve a certain distance
with a certain load.

27
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:09,050
Or, you can think about
specific resistance

28
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,130
as the time average of
the amount of power expended

29
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,979
to achieve a speed while
carrying a certain mass.

30
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:27,370
You can see from the charts that
the animals, if you disregard their load,

31
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,890
are far more cost efficient,
have much lower

32
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,520
specific resistance than any of the
machines that we've been able to build.

33
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,930
And it's only when we begin to think about
the cost of transport including load,

34
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,780
that the machines begin to be competitive.

35
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,155
Agility, there's no question.

36
00:02:48,155 --> 00:02:53,034
The animals are far more agile than
anything we've been able to build.

37
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:55,930
You think your Porsche accelerates nicely.

38
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:02,110
The Porsche accelerates from zero to
100 kilometers per hour in two seconds.

39
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,270
That's about two meters
per second per second.

40
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,660
The sailfish in the ocean,
when it's hunting, accelerates at

41
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,418
eight meters per second per
second at nearly the same speeds.

42
00:03:17,418 --> 00:03:24,900
And the cheetah, when it travels
at about 60 kilometers per hour,

43
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,880
is accelerating at least 13
meters per second squared.

44
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,570
So the animals are an order of magnitude

45
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,620
more agile if we measure
agility by acceleration.

46
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,930
We'll be spending some amount of
time in this course thinking about

47
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,620
metrics of mobility such
as specific resistance.

48
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,800
Perhaps we'll talk about agility measures.

49
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,353
And by almost any of these measures,
the animals are far,

50
00:03:54,353 --> 00:03:59,059
far better than any machine that we've yet
been able to build.

51
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:04,024
And so it behooves us to think
about what the animals know and

52
00:04:04,024 --> 00:04:06,919
to teach us concerning mobility.

53
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:09,770
There's a completely independent and

54
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:15,670
marvelous reason to think about
animals in the context of mobility.

55
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:20,940
Because evolution teaches us that
mobility is actually the very origin

56
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,650
of intelligence.

57
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:28,910
Way back in the Precambrian
era there was a shift

58
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:35,070
from primitive animals
that were filter feeders,

59
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,900
just passing the water through their
gills, their gill equivalents.

60
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,250
So they were animals in the sense
of Animalia, they were breathers,

61
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,760
they were movers but
they weren't that mobile as bodies.

62
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,590
There was a marvelous shift
around between 500 million and

63
00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:02,100
300 million years ago from mere filter
feeding to selective predation.

64
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,110
Where the animals began to
direct themselves toward other

65
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:13,130
animals so as to consume
those big packages of energy.

66
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,620
And some of the other
animals began to develop

67
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,680
escape mechanisms to remove
themselves from this predation.

68
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:26,480
And, it's been known for about 30 years
in biology, evolutionary biology now,

69
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,480
that this is the origin
of the neural crest and

70
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,930
the origin of the vertebrates and
therefore the origin of our brain.

71
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,715
It's the mobile seeking
brains that develop.

72
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:44,320
The mammalian hippocampus is the prime
of example of a seeking brain and

73
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,634
the intelligence that it confers.

74
00:05:46,634 --> 00:05:50,866
The 2014 Nobel Prize was
given to the Mosers,

75
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:55,604
an amazing married pair of
neuroscientists in Norway,

76
00:05:55,604 --> 00:05:59,050
who discovered that animals have maps.

77
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,470
It was known that animals had
some kind of mapping capability.

78
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,860
But, the the anatomy of the maps,

79
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:12,520
the seat of spacial navigation was unknown
until they showed, the Mosers did,

80
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,680
that animals have grid cells
that respond to relative

81
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,650
position and play cells that
respond to landmarks in the world.

82
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:28,900
And increasing work by cognitive
scientists and animal cognition

83
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:34,390
experts begins to reveal that
the origin of episodic memory,

84
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:39,650
our own sense of who we are, and where
we've been, and how we've come to be,

85
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,900
is deeply, deeply rooted in
this hippocampic structure.

86
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,130
It's not just the mammals
that have seeking brains,

87
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,990
although our seeking brains are
particularly well developed and advanced.

88
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,900
It seems to be every animal that's mobile.

89
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:04,120
Most animals that are mobile
develop a general cognitive map and

90
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:10,450
these maps hypothetically
arose from olfactory trackers.

91
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:15,660
Meaning long, long, long ago before
animals had very much of a nervous system

92
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,410
they had what's called chemotaxis.

93
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:22,985
They had the ability to sniff out
different concentrations of different

94
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,562
molecular substances.

95
00:07:24,562 --> 00:07:29,378
Many, many different animals
have been shown to use

96
00:07:29,378 --> 00:07:33,756
smell in conjunction
with their locomotion and

97
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:40,112
their navigation honey bees,
deep water sharks, homing pigeons.

98
00:07:40,112 --> 00:07:45,438
It seems that in those animals that
are seekers, they seek after prey or they

99
00:07:45,438 --> 00:07:51,184
seek after scarce fauna, they have larger
structures where the neuroanatomists

100
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:55,533
have found the structures,
the seat of their cognitive max.

101
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:57,183
They have larger structures,

102
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:00,700
they have larger brains if they're
involved in competitive navigation.

103
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,560
This competitive navigation arose 500
million years ago, and it was built

104
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,540
from chemotaxis, the primitive ability to
distinguish different molecular species

105
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,470
from each other, so that one would not
eat the poison and instead seek the food.

106
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,560
These notions of navigation
built on chemotaxis

107
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,690
have generated many intriguing
theories on the part of the cognitive

108
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:34,500
science of evolutionary biologist that
help us think about how to organize

109
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:43,239
navigation in robots between gradient
based or smell strengthening basis.

110
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,040
As distinct from landmark based or
topological navigation.

111
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,460
And so this is a marvelous conversation
between cognitive scientists and

112
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,970
roboticists that emerges
at the fulcrum of mobility.

113
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:03,960
We will spend much less of our
time in this course thinking about

114
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,280
the navigational capacities
of the cognitive maps.

115
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,070
But those questions and
those excitements will be there for

116
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,980
the whole lectures and you will see
them cropping up from time to time

117
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,850
as we talk about the mechanical
bases of mobility.
