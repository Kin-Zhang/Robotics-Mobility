00:00:20,094 --> 00:00:25,175
Welcome to the first week of our
special robotic course in mobility.

3
00:00:25,175 --> 00:00:29,310
This week we are going to be looking
at the background materials, and

4
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,390
we'll be motivating the effort.

5
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,150
Our first segment will involve
motivation and such questions as why,

6
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,580
how, where to move.

7
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,900
We'll spend a fair bit of time
thinking about the animals, and

8
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,530
we'll talk a fair bit
about bioinspiration.

9
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,140
And finally,
we'll move toward what it means for

10
00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:00,240
robots to take bioinspiration and
turn that inspiration into engineering.

11
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,470
At that end of that first segment,
we'll be looking at animals that don't use

12
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:10,714
their limbs, and realizing that now,
most of the animals do use their limbs.

13
00:01:10,714 --> 00:01:17,400
And we'll be spending the rest of our
MOOC time on limbed and tailed mobility.

14
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:24,240
The second half hour of this week
will be background material.

15
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,170
Those of you who are very strong on
ordinary differential equations and

16
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,670
linear algebra will race
through this segment.

17
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,740
And those of you who are weak are going
to find it important to take some time

18
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:44,300
to go through and think about the ideas
being introduced, and possibly to do

19
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:49,740
some background reading as well, in order
to follow the development of the ideas.

20
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,900
Really, it revolves around this simple
second-order differential equation that

21
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,330
most college students have in year two or

22
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:04,140
year three in engineering, and
even in other disciplines as well.

23
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,060
We'll be thinking about this
second-order mechanical

24
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:15,470
differential equation
as a dynamical system.

25
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,860
And that change in thinking takes a little
bit of getting used to, as exemplified by

26
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:26,230
these figures where on the left-hand side
of each panel you see a time trajectory.

27
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:33,020
And on the right hand side, you see
the position and the velocity on a plane.

28
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,510
And time is collapsed
down onto that plane so

29
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:44,460
that the trajectories in time become
orbits, so-called curves on the plane.

30
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,600
That idea is crucial.

31
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,900
We're not really concerned with linear
ordinary differential equations,

32
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,510
which is what you all learned in
your sophomore or junior year.

33
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,240
No, no, everything that's interesting
about mobility in robotics has to do with

34
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,890
nonlinear ordinary differential equations.

35
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:08,429
And we'll spend some time reviewing what's
known about nonlinear dynamical systems.

36
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:16,710
The most important ideas that we'll need
later have to with energy and basins.

37
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,640
Welcome to week one.

38
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,590
We'll be spending the rest of
the three weeks using these ideas and

39
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,630
turning them into marvelous robots, and

40
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,160
thinking about how our marvelous
robots might become even better.
