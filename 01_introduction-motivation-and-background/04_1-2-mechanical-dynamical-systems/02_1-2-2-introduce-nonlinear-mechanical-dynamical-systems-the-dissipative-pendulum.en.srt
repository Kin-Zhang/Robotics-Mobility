1
00:00:05,556 --> 00:00:11,390
Now we are going to take the ideas from
the previous segment that are familiar

2
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,406
to you from your correspond
ordinary differential equations and

3
00:00:16,406 --> 00:00:20,325
your course on linear algebra,
and we're going to

4
00:00:20,325 --> 00:00:25,271
delve into territory that possibly
you've never seen before.

5
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,550
There will be some exercises for

6
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,500
you to work through,
to try to fix the ideas in your thinking.

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,900
But likely, we're reaching the point
here where you will need to take more

8
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:46,810
advance courses in the future and in order
to make complete sense of these ideas.

9
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,406
Our notion of including this
material in this special MOOC

10
00:00:51,406 --> 00:00:56,282
course is that you would see how
the mathematical ideas fit and

11
00:00:56,282 --> 00:01:01,535
are needed to understand the more
complicated aspects of the robot

12
00:01:01,535 --> 00:01:06,168
behaviors that we'll be
discussing in future segments.

13
00:01:06,168 --> 00:01:11,558
In this segment,
I'll be talking about just a pendulum,

14
00:01:11,558 --> 00:01:16,838
a simple pendulum hanging in
the gravitational field and

15
00:01:16,838 --> 00:01:21,678
we will be pretending that
this pendulum is the leg.

16
00:01:21,678 --> 00:01:28,300
A one degree of freedom leg,
a swinging leg with one joint of a body.

17
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,780
If you'd prefer to think of it as an arm,
that's fine, but

18
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,660
we'd like to think about it
as the simplest appendage.

19
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:42,428
As you know in most animals and
in most robots that are interesting,

20
00:01:42,428 --> 00:01:46,185
there will be many,
many, many more joints.

21
00:01:46,185 --> 00:01:48,321
Often, they'll be revolute joints.

22
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:53,410
And so you can begin to think about
compound pendula when you start thinking

23
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:58,360
of the many jointed robot arms and
robot legs that we'll be discussing.

24
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:06,040
These many jointed pendula have far more
complicated behaviors than the simple

25
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,700
one degree of freedom pendulum
that I'll be discussing, but

26
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:16,360
the idea and the mathematical connections
are very, very much the same.

27
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:22,479
And we will try to get that idea
across by making the connection

28
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:27,777
between this non linear one degree
of freedom pendulum motion,

29
00:02:27,777 --> 00:02:31,124
which perhaps you've not seen before.

30
00:02:31,124 --> 00:02:36,778
In contrast to the one degree of
freedom linear mass on a spring

31
00:02:36,778 --> 00:02:43,970
from the previous segment that you've
seen before in physics and ODE theory.

32
00:02:47,392 --> 00:02:52,748
The first new idea that we'll
be discussing at great length

33
00:02:52,748 --> 00:02:57,783
in a future segment on kinematics
is the relative motion

34
00:02:57,783 --> 00:03:03,141
between constrained rigid
bodies creates the normality,

35
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:08,518
because the pendulum swings around and
around and around.

36
00:03:08,518 --> 00:03:14,054
The mass comes back to the same
place that it's been, which would

37
00:03:14,054 --> 00:03:20,210
never be possible in the straight
line motion of the original protocol.

38
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,959
This periodic phenomenon is characteristic
of all the interesting kinematics,

39
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,615
revolute joints are much more useful
in general than prismatic joints as

40
00:03:31,615 --> 00:03:34,614
you'll come to see in
our kinematic section.

41
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:38,850
Yet, they account for
the origin of the normality.

42
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:44,002
So let's look at the picture of
the simple pendulum with point mass, m at

43
00:03:44,002 --> 00:03:49,666
some position p and I'd like you to think
about p as having a spacial component.

44
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:55,144
There's a position on the plane
in the horizontal direction x and

45
00:03:55,144 --> 00:03:59,426
a position on the plane in
a vertical direction z and

46
00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:04,705
there's this fixed distance l,
which the masses constrained

47
00:04:04,705 --> 00:04:10,900
to travel on there by forming a circular
arc, whenever it travels at all.

48
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,800
It can travel along that circular arc for
many, many,

49
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,190
many degrees depending on
how much energy it has.

50
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:24,360
So our variable p,
which looks like a planer variable,

51
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,422
because it has two components, px and

52
00:04:27,422 --> 00:04:31,630
pz is really a one degree
of freedom variable, but

53
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:38,100
a nonlinear freedom variable wstablished
by the kinematics of the simple pendulum.

54
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:44,000
We'll model the geometric
relation using polar coordinates,

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,950
which you'll remember from
high school probably.

56
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,450
Namely, we'd like to think
about the horizontal and

57
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,560
the vertical components
of this point mass, p

58
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:01,850
as having a radial component l, which is
fixed and an angular component theta.

59
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:09,644
So that using trigonometry,
we can express the position p, px and

60
00:05:09,644 --> 00:05:14,480
pz as the function g
of the variable theta.

61
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:19,063
Theta is a scalar variable, g is a vector.

62
00:05:19,063 --> 00:05:23,058
So g takes the scalar variable, theta,

63
00:05:23,058 --> 00:05:27,405
the angle of the pendulum and
gives us back,

64
00:05:27,405 --> 00:05:32,457
reads out for us,
the Cartesian positions, px and

65
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:38,920
pz of the mass that's constrained
to ride on that pendulum.

66
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:44,623
G is a special function and
its called the kinematic function or

67
00:05:44,623 --> 00:05:49,788
the forward kinematics and
we think about it as mapping,

68
00:05:49,788 --> 00:05:54,522
the joint space that is
the space of shaft angles into

69
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:58,954
the workspace,
that is the space of positions.

70
00:05:58,954 --> 00:06:04,212
When we introduce the kinematics ideas
later on in this MOOC, we will talk about

71
00:06:04,212 --> 00:06:09,394
kinematics at great length, but
we will be increasingly less mathematical,

72
00:06:09,394 --> 00:06:14,725
because the mathematics becomes very,
very much more complicated.

73
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:19,657
Here in this segment, we're still
going to talk about the concepts in

74
00:06:19,657 --> 00:06:22,345
the mathematics in a unified manner.

75
00:06:22,345 --> 00:06:27,073
Hoping that it will give you some
insight later on when you study these

76
00:06:27,073 --> 00:06:30,425
more complicated kinematics
in greater depth.

77
00:06:34,948 --> 00:06:41,270
So we will now having discussed
the kinematics of the pendulum,

78
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:49,715
we will now introduce the dynamics of the
pendulum by introducing a potential force.

79
00:06:49,715 --> 00:06:53,610
The potential force that we're
interested in, of course is gravity.

80
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:58,190
Gravity in the Cartesian world
looks like a constant accelerator.

81
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:04,011
So gravity adds 9.8 meters per
second squared acceleration and

82
00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:08,676
you can see that we now have a new
differential equation in theta.

83
00:07:08,676 --> 00:07:13,530
It looks a little bit like the high
double dot equation that we had before in

84
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,820
the previous segment on linear time and
variant,

85
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,658
one degree of freedom particle dynamics.

86
00:07:19,658 --> 00:07:23,668
But now we've got
the nonlinear term sine theta,

87
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:29,986
which is a consequence of the nonlinearity
introduced through the kinematics

88
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:39,760
Well, we could agonize about
solving this differential equation.

89
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,602
We've given the dynamics and
l squared theta double dot

90
00:07:44,602 --> 00:07:49,445
equals this right-hand side
function sine theta, but

91
00:07:49,445 --> 00:07:54,700
we'll find that the mathematicians
have discovered a while

92
00:07:54,700 --> 00:08:00,490
ago that these nonlinear systems
cannot be solved in closed form.

93
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,589
The way the Linear Systems
can be solved in closed form.

94
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:09,550
Fortunately, the energy dynamical
systems point of view that we took in

95
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:14,917
the previous slide, where we thought
about the energy in a norm like fashion,

96
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:19,909
those ideas do generalize, and
we'll proceed to use those ideas here.

97
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:29,970
Well, how can we repeat the analysis of
the linear case in this nominal setting?

98
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:30,942
Let's remember what we did.

99
00:08:30,942 --> 00:08:37,811
We realized that there was a Kai,
Kai dot plane.

100
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,880
Here, we're going to realize that
there is a theta, theta dot plain.

101
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,610
Namely, what we will do is we will
assign to q one, the variable theta.

102
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,140
And we will assign to q two
the variable theta, theta dot.

103
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,070
Please keep in mind that q,
the phase variable.

104
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,400
Is two dimensional for a very,
very different reason that p.

105
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,900
P is the partition position
of the point mass.

106
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,910
Really, this point mass is constraint to
have just one degree of freedom, theta.

107
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:22,080
So, we are looking now with the variable
q, at the phase space of theta,

108
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,010
namely q has coordinance, position and

109
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:31,370
velocity even thought
unlike the old vector x

110
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,810
in the previous segment,
the vector q lives in a non linear space.

111
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,470
We can write down a first order
depherntial equation in q the same way

112
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:49,782
we wrote down the first order depherntial
equation in x in the previous section.

113
00:09:49,782 --> 00:09:56,740
Namely q one dot d by d
t of theta is theta dot

114
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:02,160
which is just the second derivative and
second position q2.

115
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:12,760
In q2 dot we realize q2
dot is d by dt of q1.

116
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:18,140
So, d by dt of b by dt of q one,
is q one double dot, and

117
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:22,260
q one double dot means that we should
solve for theta double dot in this

118
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:27,245
scalar second order physical
version of this first order,

119
00:10:27,245 --> 00:10:29,790
two-dimensional system
that we're writing down.

120
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:36,820
The mathematician's understand enough
about equation five that they can promise

121
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,350
us that every initial condition still has
a good projectory that I'm denoting q of

122
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,990
t through the initial condition q0.

123
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,240
But unlike the original
equation of the linear time and

124
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,280
varying case,
qt is not available in closed form.

125
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,810
Let's push on.

126
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:03,470
Instead, let's try to use
an energy conservation argument to

127
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,740
reduce the properties of q(t) over time.

128
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,674
Let me write down again

129
00:11:11,828 --> 00:11:15,340
the total energy of the simple pendulum.

130
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:22,080
Now, I'm going to write down the kinetic
energy of the pendulum which depends only

131
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,610
on the velocity q2.

132
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:29,320
Together with the potential energy
due to gravity which depends only

133
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,090
on the angle position q1.

134
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,760
I once again must do
the power calculation.

135
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,870
That I tried to do an succeeded
in the linear case.

136
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:46,810
Namely, I would like to show
that with no dissipation at

137
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:51,330
all Hamilton was correct and
the total energy is conserved.

138
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,690
Let's do that computation.

139
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,000
Let's show that D by DT of Ata.

140
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,520
When Ata is composed along
the motions of this system,

141
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,090
that d by d t of Ata is always zero,
so that ata is constant.

142
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:11,748
I'm going to write down in theta and
theta dot coordinates, and

143
00:12:11,748 --> 00:12:17,770
then rewrite them in q1 q2
coordinates to get the expression

144
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:22,050
for Ata as a function of q at any time, t.

145
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:30,110
I'm going to realize that
because of conservation

146
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:35,315
it's true and
I can rewrite q either q1 or q2,

147
00:12:35,315 --> 00:12:40,780
let's say we'll write q2
as a function of q1 and

148
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:45,362
now, I'm plotting on the q1 q2 plane-

149
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:52,255
In red the function Q2
of Q1 that we get by

150
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:57,378
assuming that the total
energy is conserved

151
00:13:02,265 --> 00:13:09,265
If we add damping it will turn
out that there's a viscous churn.

152
00:13:09,265 --> 00:13:14,033
And our d by dt computation of
total energy will reveal what

153
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:18,412
Lord Kelvin realized,
which is that the total energy

154
00:13:18,412 --> 00:13:23,300
is no longer conserved, but
must be decaying down to zero.

155
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:29,460
These computations are not hard to do,
but they will take some time, and

156
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,040
we provide exercises for

157
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,600
you to work on them if you care to In
a supplementary material to this lecture.

158
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,310
Let's now pass on, assuming that
these derivations are correct,

159
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,760
and interpret the change of energy,

160
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,390
the negative change of energy
as a basin like property.

161
00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:00,830
Namely, we're going to look at
two different trajectories.

162
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:05,770
We're going to look at the trajectory
around the fixed point

163
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:10,480
at the bottom and
the fixed point at the top.

164
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,870
What do I mean by a fixed point?

165
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:16,620
I mean, what you know physically that if
you position the pendulum in the earths

166
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,340
gravitational field with no velocity,

167
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:24,030
with the pendulum pointing straight down,
it will stay there forever.

168
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:31,130
Similarly, if you position the pendulum
straight up with no velocity and

169
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:36,510
you balance it exactly right intuitively
that it will also stay there forever.

170
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,390
But you also intuitively know that
these two different fixed points or

171
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:47,240
fixed positions of the pendula have
very very very different behaviors.

172
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:54,310
If you position the pendulum underneath
down under, it will stay there forever and

173
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:59,100
if you bump it It will at least
oscillate and if there's damping,

174
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:05,860
it will oscillate back down to
the 0,0 no energy position.

175
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,610
In contrast,
if you start with the pendulum

176
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,760
pointed exactly up at the fixed point.

177
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,980
And you bump it a little bit.

178
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,450
Whether or not there's damping.

179
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:25,562
This pendulum will escape
from its top position, and

180
00:15:25,562 --> 00:15:31,478
it will continue to oscillate
forever if there's no damping or

181
00:15:31,478 --> 00:15:37,634
it will die down to the bottom
under fixed point asymptotically.

182
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:41,880
In either case,
the top behavior is unstable,

183
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,852
the bottom behavior is stable and

184
00:15:44,852 --> 00:15:50,373
we must now develop a mathematical
way of thinking about it and

185
00:15:50,373 --> 00:15:55,918
analyzing and talking about
such different circumstances.

186
00:15:55,918 --> 00:16:00,839
Let's look at the behavior down under,
a stable fixed point.

187
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:04,670
The equilibrium motion or the fixed
point motion is constant over time.

188
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,950
Namely, if I start at theta equals
zero and theta dot equals zero,

189
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,040
I'll stay there forever.

190
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:15,730
The pendulum at the top with
theta is equal to pi, and

191
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:21,420
theta dot is equal to zero, is also a
fixed point, but will show it's unstable.

192
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,670
First, let's define what
we mean by stability.

193
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,080
Stability is the notion that
motions that start close together

194
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,360
should stay close together.

195
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:41,150
Asymptotic stability, which is even
more important to us, adds the notion

196
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,420
that motions that start close together,
not only stay close together, but

197
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:53,260
actually come asymptotically closer and
closer until they converge.

198
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,680
You know intuitively

199
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,450
that this is just whats going to
happen to the damped pendulum.

200
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:07,530
You know that if you knock it a little
bit off it's bottom fixed point, that

201
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:11,990
it'll oscillate a little bit, and settle
down to the zero, zero, zero energy state.

202
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:19,325
We would like to use energy methods to
show that this is true mathematically.

203
00:17:19,325 --> 00:17:23,753
Let's look at the pendulum
near the bottom, and

204
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:29,933
we'll see that its total energy
gives us a norm-like shape curve.

205
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:36,135
There close circles close to the bottom
when we express total energy level curves,

206
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:37,875
and since the power is non positive,

207
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,235
we know that we're going to get a red,
yellow,

208
00:17:40,235 --> 00:17:45,985
blue picture in the non-use setting,
just like what we got in the linear case.

209
00:17:45,985 --> 00:17:51,520
In the linear case, these red curves
were analytically determined.

210
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,930
In this case, these red curves
are developed by numerical simulation,

211
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,950
and they're not closed form,
but mathematically we

212
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:04,970
know that they must be converging for the
exact same arguments that we used before.

213
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:09,680
We conclude that the bottom fixed
point has asymptotic stability,

214
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,190
and we've never needed to solve for

215
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:17,320
the motions, because we showed that
the total energy is decreasing.

216
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,830
That idea is summarized in this
total energy basin picture,

217
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:31,280
where you see the red motions in
the face plain, Q1, Q2 face plain below.

218
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:37,710
And projected up onto the energy
surface as blue ghost curves

219
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,510
showing that all the energy
is being sucked out

220
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:47,290
of any of these initial conditions by
the viscous damping of the pendulum shaft.

221
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:54,540
In contrast, let's go to the unstable
fixed point at the top, and

222
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,530
do the same computation.

223
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,370
The power is still nonpositive.

224
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,750
D by D T of ata is still negative, so

225
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:08,540
the power is still nonpositive, and
so the energy must be decreasing.

226
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,540
But let's see what that means.

227
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:17,860
If we plot the level curves of
the total energy function near the top,

228
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,720
where theta dot is equal to 0 but

229
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:25,350
theta is equal to pi, then we see that
our level curves are saddle like.

230
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:31,940
And indeed when we plot numerically in
red, the solution trajectories over time,

231
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,930
we see that energy indeed is decreasing,
but

232
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:40,360
it's decreasing by running down in
one direction, and then running

233
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,710
down further in the other direction
till we get bluer, and bluer, and bluer.

234
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,970
So energy dissipation in this
case does not apply convergence.

235
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,600
Around the unstable fixed point,
the total energy is not norm-like, and

236
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,770
therefore its decay does not tell
us anything about stability, and

237
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,370
in fact enables us to deduce instability.

238
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:06,640
We conclude that it's lonely at the top,
it's unstable at the top.

239
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,430
And we show this again by thinking about
the total energy surface as a saddle

240
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:17,450
in space, where the red motions
over time are being projected

241
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:22,520
into these blue ghost curves on the energy
surface, and we can see that running

242
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,950
down the saddle doesn't mean that your
going to run to the point of the saddle.

243
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:32,090
It means that your going to run near
the point and run off the saddle,

244
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:35,980
all the way down to
the stable fixed point below.

245
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,840
We can do this without ever
computing the solutions.

246
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,470
I find it convenient to illustrate what's
going on with these red numerically

247
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:48,470
computed trajectories, but the blue story
is all you need mathematically to conclude

248
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:51,980
that this fixed point is unstable,
and the fixed point below is stable.

249
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,450
The total energy basin defines a task.

250
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,910
We're going to think about
these energy basins as

251
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:08,760
task symbols, and we're going to try
to start composing these task symbols

252
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:13,070
later on in this series of lectures.

253
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:18,000
The Basin properties were established
rigorously only in the late 20th Century.

254
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,710
These are greedy, tireless efforts
of the physical system to get

255
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:26,550
to the bottom of the local fixed point,
and we're going to try always to

256
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:31,020
encode what we want out of our
robots in these very robust terms,

257
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,170
because we don't need to know that
much about the initial conditions.

258
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:37,490
We don't need to know that much
about the details of the friction.

259
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,570
All we need to know is
that the friction or

260
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:44,260
whatever energetic method is pulling the
energy away from the fixed points we don't

261
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,190
like toward the fixed
points that we do like.

262
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,729
Best yet, these properties are persistent,
in that we don't need to know exactly what

263
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:55,885
the masses are or
exactly what the spring constants are.

264
00:21:55,885 --> 00:22:01,049
These properties will still
persist under in the parameters.

265
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,700
So the notion of dynamical task encoding,
ideas that I began to think about 20 or

266
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,530
30 years ago, have lasted, and

267
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:14,210
generalized, and
enable us to begin to implement more and

268
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:18,669
more complicated behavior using artificial
potential energy landscape functions.

269
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,550
These ideas we're going to try and

270
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:27,270
convey to you more intuitively
as the segments go along.

271
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:31,820
But we included this more mathematical
rendition in the simple one degree of

272
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:36,310
freedom case, so that you could if you
wanted to make the connection between

273
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:41,180
the intuitive ideas that we're presenting
later, and the mathematics that underpins

274
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:46,340
them, and introduce those ideas
to your future study goals.
