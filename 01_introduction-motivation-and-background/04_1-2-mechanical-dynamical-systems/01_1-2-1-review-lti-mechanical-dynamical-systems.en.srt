00:00:07,947 --> 00:00:11,060
In this section, we're going to
review the study of kinematics,

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,090
which is related to the motion of bodies.

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,140
This is distinct from dynamics,

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,630
because we don't consider the forces that
cause the accelerations of these bodies.

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,330
First, we define the phrase
degrees of freedom.

6
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,590
These are the number of parameters that
fully define the system in its space.

7
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,220
A rigid body and
ambient space has six degrees of freedom.

8
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,770
Typically, they are x, y, and z,
which are three positions, and roll,

9
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,710
pitch, and yaw, which are three angles.

10
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,360
In this figure,
we see a plane who's degrees of freedom

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,250
have been highlighted in
the typical convention.

12
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,400
In robotics, we're interested in
both active degrees of freedom,

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,340
which are explicitly controlled by
actuators, as well as the passive degrees

14
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,610
of freedom that are governed
by the system's dynamics.

15
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,610
Most robots are highly underactuated.

16
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:01,070
This means that the majority of
the degrees of freedom are passive and

17
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,690
not controlled by the system's actuators.

18
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,998
In this video, we see the pendulum robot.

19
00:01:05,998 --> 00:01:09,280
The body of the robot has
only two degrees of freedom,

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,290
as it is constrained on a boom.

21
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,620
The leg also has two degrees of freedom.

22
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,220
One of which, the rotation, is active
as it is controlled by the motor.

23
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,893
The other is the extension of the leg,

24
00:01:19,893 --> 00:01:22,099
which is simply governed
by the attached spring.

25
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:30,573
Joints are an example of
a holonomic constraint and

26
00:01:30,573 --> 00:01:33,840
reduce the number of degrees
of freedom of a system.

27
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,740
In this video,

28
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,380
we see a leg from the minitaur robot
demonstrating multiple revolute joints.

29
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,290
In this video, we see a similar
leg jumping on a linear rail.

30
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,620
All of the pin joints
in the minitaur leg and

31
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:55,180
the linear rail constrain the attached
links to only one degree of freedom.

32
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,650
Another example of a joint that has
one degree of freedom is a screw

33
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,580
even though the translation and
rotation are coupled.

34
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,830
An example of a two degree of
freedom joint in the plane

35
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,490
is an idealized wheel spinning on ice.

36
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,730
The rotation and
translation are completely decoupled.

37
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:15,570
Kutzbach's equation determines the number
of degrees of freedom in a planar system.

38
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,967
M is the number of degrees of freedom,
N is the number of links in the system,

39
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:23,198
J1 is the number of one-degree
of freedom joints, and

40
00:02:23,198 --> 00:02:26,570
J2 is the number of
two-degree of freedom joints.

41
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,890
Once solved, if M is equal to zero,

42
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,580
the system is fully constrained and
can't move.

43
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,480
Another class of constraints
are called non-holonomic,

44
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,950
meaning they cannot be described
using the position of the system.

45
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,700
These constraints that are not only
a function of position can, for

46
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,300
example, be a function of velocity.

47
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,100
In this video, we see that the car wants
to move sideways into the parking spot.

48
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,340
However, there's a non-holonomic
constraint preventing

49
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,170
any lateral velocity.

50
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,801
The car can however translate in that
direction using a parallel parking

51
00:02:57,801 --> 00:02:58,405
manuever.

52
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:05,387
We are now interested in establishing
a relationship between the position of

53
00:03:05,387 --> 00:03:08,731
the robots end effector,
X, in its free space, and

54
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:12,390
all of the machines joint angles, theta.

55
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,780
The forward kinematics are when
the joint angles are known and

56
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,120
the position of the end
effector is to be determined.

57
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,440
Typically, in robot arms, the joint angles
are known as they are instrumented, and

58
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,070
so it is of interest to figure out
where the end effector will be

59
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,420
given a set of joint angles.

60
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,370
Inverse kinematics pose the opposite
problem where the position

61
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,680
of the end effector is known and
a joint angles are to be computed.

62
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,140
In this video,
we see a robot arm doing a welding task.

63
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,960
The end effector needs to follow a desired
trajectory in ambiance space and so

64
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,980
inverse kinematics must be use
back out the joint angles.

65
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,591
These joint angles are then passed to the
machine as desired angles for the motor.

66
00:04:00,603 --> 00:04:05,180
Here we see a much simpler
revolute-revolute robot arm.

67
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,720
The angle between the first link and
the base is theta one and

68
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,440
the angle between the first link and
the second link is theta two.

69
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,230
It's important to note that
theta two is a relative angle.

70
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,600
Since the position of the end effector,
X, is a function, F,

71
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,530
of the joint angles, theta, calculating
F represents the forward kinematics.

72
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,480
Some dimensions have been broken out in
this image to help solve the problem of

73
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,310
forward kinematics.

74
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,830
Using the same revolute-revolute arm,
if the end effector position is known,

75
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,620
inverse kinematics can let us solve for
the joint angles.

76
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,720
Since the forward kinematics are known,

77
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,330
this represents a system
of non-linear equations.

78
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,740
The inverse kinematics can be
found from the forward kinematics

79
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,619
by solving a system of equations.

80
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,140
Generally, this system of
equations is non-linear and

81
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,450
can be solved with
trigonometric identities.

82
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:06,330
Simpler cases can be solved in MATLAB by
making the desired variables symbolic and

83
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,360
using the solve function.

84
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,180
Solving the inverse kinematics
amounts to inverting

85
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,059
the system of equations
represented by the function F.

86
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,070
All the previous linkages that
we've considered are serial

87
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,590
in that there's only one chain between
the ground and the end effector.

88
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,700
Parallel mechanisms have multiple chains
connecting the end effector to the ground.

89
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,740
Solving the kinematics of parallel
mechanism is much more difficult than for

90
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,450
serial mechanisms.

91
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:39,620
Here we will go over a concrete
example using the minitaur leg.

92
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,786
In this figure we see the minitaur leg
with the motor angles theta one and

93
00:05:43,786 --> 00:05:45,250
theta two Illustrated.

94
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,989
We would like to solve
the forward kinematics and

95
00:05:49,989 --> 00:05:53,877
so get a solution for X and Y as
a function of theta one and theta two.

96
00:05:53,877 --> 00:05:58,780
This task greatly simplified if we
use a couple of coordinate changes.

97
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:03,000
The first coordinate change that will
be helpful is to go from theta one and

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,480
theta two to alpha and beta,
the mean and different coordinates.

99
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,790
Once alpha and beta are computed,

100
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:14,560
a further coordinate change to polar
coordinates help solve the problem.

101
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,130
We now consider the infinitesimal
kinematics for these linkages.

102
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:23,330
This is done by computing the matrix
of partial derivatives of the system

103
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,350
known as the Jacobian.

104
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,040
Here we see the Jacobian,

105
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,480
J, computed where the rows represent
the system of equations and

106
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,750
the columns represent the partial
derivatives of the different joint angles.

107
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,340
By multiplying the Jacobian by
DT over DT and rearranging,

108
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,000
we see that the Jacobian describes the
relationship between joint velocities and

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,460
velocities at the end effector.

110
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,350
Thanks to the principle of virtual
work the Jacobian transpose

111
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,580
can be used to relate the forces at the
end effector to the torques at the joints.

112
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,210
This Jacobian transpose inverse represents
the effective mechanical advantage for

113
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,580
the system.

114
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,170
It scales the torques at the joint
into forces at the end effector.
