1
00:00:05,362 --> 00:00:09,309
Those of you who have taken
multivariable calculus will remember

2
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,470
the Multivariable Taylor Series.

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,060
What is a Taylor Series?

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:18,600
Well my immutable colleague
professor Rob Griest,

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,680
who has the world's best calculus MOOC,
teaches us that we should think about

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,850
nice functions as being very, very, very
long polynomials, meaning that you can

7
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:35,330
expand nice functions by Taylor Series
into higher and higher and

8
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:40,480
higher degree polynomials, and get better
and better and better approximations.

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,210
This is called Taylor's Theorem.

10
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:49,650
And the notion of nice's captured
formally by the word analytic.

11
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,460
Go take Rob’s course if you’re
interested in what this means.

12
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,070
From our point of view what
it means is that we can

13
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,740
expand a functions f of x at any point x.

14
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,890
In the neighborhood of some
interesting .x* using the value

15
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:14,370
of function adec * plus
a linear approximation,

16
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,780
achieved by taking the derivative
of the function of x*, and

17
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:26,600
multiplying the difference from that
x star point by that derivative, and

18
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,830
then forgetting about a bunch of remainder
terms called the Taylor Remainder,

19
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,740
which are guaranteed to get very,
very small very quickly.

20
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:43,120
We'll think about this second
term as the linearization

21
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,810
of the nonlinear function f(x).

22
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:52,780
And let me remind you that
capital F at x* is the Jacobean.

23
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,374
It's the matrix of partial derivatives
evaluated at that point of interest.

24
00:01:59,425 --> 00:02:05,211
The linearisation of F at x* turns
out to be extremely important and

25
00:02:05,211 --> 00:02:09,080
valuable in the world
of dynamical systems.

26
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,740
If you recall the first segment,

27
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,965
we showed that a linear dynamical
system could be completely solved.

28
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,540
Whereas, in general, nonlinear
dynamical systems are unsolvable.

29
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,458
However, there's the hope that
the linearized dynamics of a non

30
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:33,538
linear system might actually
closely describe the properties

31
00:02:33,538 --> 00:02:40,080
of that non linear system at least in
the neighborhood of a distinguished point.

32
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,664
We'll illustrate this again using
our damped pendulum back from

33
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:49,260
the previous sections, so
I'm plotting for you in equation 6.

34
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,232
I'm writing down for you, again,

35
00:02:51,232 --> 00:02:55,728
a reminder of what the right hand side of
the differential equation looked like.

36
00:02:55,728 --> 00:03:01,650
F sub sp the function, the field vector or

37
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,436
the vector field, as it's called, of the
simple pendulum on the right hand side.

38
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:10,824
At the bottom point,
at the bottom equilibrium state,

39
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:17,476
let's evaluate the Jacobean,
the matrix of partial derivatives,

40
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:22,192
of little f, sub sp, at q*, q* being 0,0.

41
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:26,720
And let's plug that q* into
the Jacobean matrix, capital F.

42
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,950
And let's evaluate it, and that's exactly
what we've done in this bottom row.

43
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,030
That's the linearized dynamics
of this nom in your system,

44
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,290
the pendulum, at its bottom fixed point.

45
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,030
At the top, we have the same formula for
the Jacobean, but

46
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:52,090
notice that we're plugging in the top
fixed point, which is the angle at theta,

47
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:58,380
180 degrees above ground, above the
downward pointing part, and at 0 velocity.

48
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:05,059
And when we plug that value of theta in,
of course, we get a rather different

49
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:10,353
matrix, the same Jacobean matrix,
the same linearization function,

50
00:04:10,353 --> 00:04:14,540
but it's being evaluated
at two very different q*'s.

51
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,640
First we did it at the bottom, and
the second we did it at the top.

52
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:22,849
We're going to introduce changes
of coordinates to talk about

53
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:25,950
the normal forms of
these dynamical systems.

54
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,150
First, in general,
that is away from fixed points.

55
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,970
And then in particular,
close to fixed points.

56
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:41,450
A change of coordinates is a one to
one in smooth continuous function.

57
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:45,420
That is continuous partial derivatives,
continuous Jacobean matrix.

58
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:52,940
If it's inverse function is also smooth,
then we'll call a change of coordinates.

59
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,760
And what we would like to do is,

60
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,484
we would like to write the old
dynamics in the new coordinates.

61
00:04:58,484 --> 00:05:03,220
To do so,
if we're given a differential equation,

62
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,492
x dot = f(x), and
a change of coordinate, y = h(x),

63
00:05:08,492 --> 00:05:13,121
where h is one of these
continuously invertible and

64
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:16,051
continuous smooth functions.

65
00:05:16,051 --> 00:05:19,215
Then we'll take D by Dt of y, and

66
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:24,870
we'll use the chain rule to
get our hands on D by Dt of x.

67
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,080
Let's do that.

68
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,080
We'll see that y dot is in the chain rule.

69
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,630
Is the Jacobean of h
times times d by dt of x.

70
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:39,210
But x d by dt solves
the differential equation.

71
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,609
And so that reduces to the Jacobean
of h times the vector field f.

72
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,430
But we can substitute for
x in that equation by using h inverse.

73
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:57,140
And so suddenly we have a new differential
equation, y dot equals f tilde of y,

74
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:02,170
where f tilde of y is said
to be conjugate to f.

75
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:06,240
It's not the same form as f.

76
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,670
F tilde is very, very different.

77
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,400
It looks very,
very different when you write it down.

78
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,750
But it has the same properties and
the same behaviors.

79
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:20,790
In exactly analogous way to
the diagonalized matrix capturing

80
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:26,290
the linear properties in normal
coordinates of the matrix,

81
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:31,000
whose eigenvectors you
found to diagonalize it.

82
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,130
The normal form of any vector
field away from a fixed point

83
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,990
is always a constant vector field, simple.

84
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,840
It's not to say that the original vector
field had this simple behavior, but

85
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,370
it's conjugate to it, and

86
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,310
so a change of coordinates will
make it look simple in that way.

87
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:56,060
We're interested in the normal
form at fixed points as well.

88
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,280
So what we mean by the normal form is
reducing by change of coordinates,

89
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,710
a function to it's simplest
polynomial conjugate.

90
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:09,750
The Flowbox Theorem,
to summarize this idea, says that

91
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:15,540
if you are away from the fixed point, then
your dynamics is conjugate automatically.

92
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,815
At least in the small neighborhood
of any non-fixed point.

93
00:07:18,815 --> 00:07:23,640
Your dynamics is conjugate to
a boring old constant flow dynamics.

94
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,620
The normal form near a fixed
point is much more interesting.

95
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:40,380
The Taylor Remainder never is going to
be of interest to us in this discussion,

96
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,386
but the constant term at a fixed
point by definition, vanishes.

97
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:47,340
We suppose that x* is a fixed point, and

98
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,490
what that means is that f vanishes
at x* as depicted in this equation.

99
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:02,343
Now, our leading term is the linear
vector field, capital F evaluated x*.

100
00:08:02,343 --> 00:08:06,940
Where remember capital F is
the matrix of partial derivatives of

101
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:11,880
the original non-linear field
evaluated at the fixed point x*.

102
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,180
It dominates.

103
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,400
And it turns out not only does it
dominate, but there's a theorem

104
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,600
the Hartman Grobman Theorem,
which I am going to abbreviate HA, and

105
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,860
I'm going to call it
the Hyperbolic Approximation Theorem.

106
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,250
You have to look at more complicated
books to really understand this theorem.

107
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:35,839
But what we should understand is that in
the neighborhood of a nice fixed point,

108
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,370
the non-linear dynamics is
conjugate to its linearization.

109
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,490
Not only is the linearized dynamics
dominating but it actually completely

110
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:51,950
captures the behavior so long as x*
has the property of being hyperbolic

111
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:57,260
which is a fancy way of saying it
has no purely imaginary eigenvalues.

112
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,640
Again, this is a very long story that
I'm just giving a small mention of,

113
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:10,540
and I'm referring you to the legendary
textbook by Professor John Guckenheimer

114
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:15,310
and Phil Holmes, that is still
considered to be the Bible of

115
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:19,179
nonlinear dynamical systems, if you become
interested in following these ideas.

116
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,800
The fixed point at the bottom, now,
we're being told by this theorem,

117
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:33,380
should be captured, behaviorally,
by the linearized dynamics at the bottom.

118
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,760
Well, the linearized dynamics is
governed in turn by the eigenvalues,

119
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,990
the roots of the characteristic
polynomial of that matrix,

120
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,590
that we just calculated
in the previous slide.

121
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,040
Let's compute the eigenvalues.

122
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:56,449
And we see that the eigenvalues actually
are negative, have negative real part.

123
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,930
The have nonzero real part assuming
assuming we have positive damping.

124
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:12,000
The behavior near
a hyperbolic fix point then,

125
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,450
including the stability behavior,
is governed by the linearized dynamics.

126
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,190
And so the change of coordinates
preserves the stability properties.

127
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:24,930
Continuous, continuously changeable change
of coordinates takes bounded sets, so

128
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,040
it preserves stability.

129
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,607
It's continuous, and
so it preserves limits,

130
00:10:29,607 --> 00:10:31,490
so we preserve asymptotic stability.

131
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:35,226
And so the stability properties
have to be the same, and so

132
00:10:35,226 --> 00:10:40,810
the lineraization governs the stability
properties of the hyperbolic fixed points.

133
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,140
Taylor says linearization dominates,
hyperbolic approximation

134
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,900
guarantees that linearization
actually determines stability.

135
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,170
So that the damped pendulum
near the fixed point

136
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:59,420
can be understood behaviorally by
looking at it's linearization.

137
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:05,550
And here I depict that
by juxtaposing the red

138
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:13,080
nominare flow against the linearized
dynamics of the flow near the fixed

139
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:18,010
points for different parametric values of
the pendulum down at it's fixed point.

140
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,380
Again, we have some exercises where you
can do some of these calculations, and

141
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,390
do some of your own exploring,
but we'll press on.

142
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,521
In contrast, near and
very near the top fixed point,

143
00:11:31,521 --> 00:11:36,363
we once again see that the nonlinear
dynamics is closely approximated

144
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:40,976
by linear saddles, and
the linear saddles are clearly unstable.
