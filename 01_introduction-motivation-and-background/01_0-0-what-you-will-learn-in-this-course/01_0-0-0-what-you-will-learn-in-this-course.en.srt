00:00:15,087 --> 00:00:19,729
Welcome to the special module on
mobility within the Robotics MOOC at

3
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:22,980
the University of Pennsylvania.

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,337
In this course, we're going to spend
four weeks talking about mobility.

5
00:00:27,337 --> 00:00:31,874
In week one, we'll quickly,
quickly understand that the animals

6
00:00:31,874 --> 00:00:35,786
are the key to mobility and
we'll focus on limb mobility.

7
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:39,702
And we'll realize to get that right,
we need to think about physics and energy,

8
00:00:39,702 --> 00:00:40,980
and the exchange of work.

9
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,290
In week two,
we'll break down the components.

10
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,730
Behavioral components like this pogo
stick that we'll be talking about,

11
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,720
and physical components like
these strength of materials and

12
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,740
structural properties that
we'll be talking about.

13
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,960
Don't worry.

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,880
We're going to be thinking about
how to put them together and

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,260
build bodies with limbs out of
these components in week three.

16
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:13,540
We'll think about kinematics which is
the study of the way limbs move in space.

17
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,439
We'll add dynamics and so you can begin to
think about these hopping machines that

18
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:23,347
use pogo stick like ideas even though they
don't look very much like pogo sticks.

19
00:01:23,347 --> 00:01:30,110
Finally, in week 4 we'll be ready to talk
about what's known of programming work.

20
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,900
How do you compose more complicated
behaviors out of simple pieces?

21
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,220
And these energy bases begin to be shaped.

22
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,690
And as they're shaped properly, we begin
to snap together different components.

23
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:48,150
And as we snap together these simpler
components into more complicated bodies,

24
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,910
we anchor them into the behaviors
that we really wish to achieve.

25
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,380
Here's an example of the horizons
of research, Aaron Johnson's

26
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,720
leaping robot trying to scramble
up the ledge of a table.

27
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,100

component of the robotics
