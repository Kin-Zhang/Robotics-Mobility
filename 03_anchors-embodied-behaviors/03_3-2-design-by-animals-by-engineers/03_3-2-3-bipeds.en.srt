1
00:00:05,928 --> 00:00:07,710
Now we're moving on to bipeds.

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,190
We saw that some of the quadrupeds that
we talked about were quite accomplished

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,200
animals, as well as robots.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,700
What is a reason for us to move to bipeds?

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,390
For animals,
manipulation is actually a key motivator.

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,180
Animals would have liked to use their
full limbs to manipulate optics and

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,860
not just walk around.

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:32,470
They developed an upright posture which
is known as orthograde versus pronograde.

9
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,880
They developed muscles for
supporting their core to be upright and

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,300
they also develop mechanisms for
endurance.

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,760
It's very curious that humans are actually
one of the best marathon runners in

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,110
the world, whereas even your house cat
could probably outrun you in a sprint.

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,680
That's because bipeds
developed mechanisms for

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,310
endurance that a lot of
quadrupeds can't have.

15
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,270
One of the reasons for
this has been termed carrier's constraint.

16
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:06,900
In a pronorate animal the forelimb muscles
are connected very close to the lungs.

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,310
What happens because of this
is that the stride rate

18
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,750
is coupled to the breathing rate.

19
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,110
So the biomechanical energetics,
i.e the stride length and

20
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,000
stride length, compete with the preferred
breathing rate for the animal.

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,099
Paleontologist Richard Cowen wrote this
funny limerick to help you remember

22
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:25,699
this fact.

23
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:36,144
You can see in this plot the horse's cost
of transport given by the dotted line

24
00:01:36,144 --> 00:01:39,699
versus a human's cost of transport
you can see the human has

25
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:43,720
a very flat cost of transport
past a certain speed.

26
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,330
That's where it's running.

27
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,690
And since the human can alter its
breathing rate independent of stride rate,

28
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,390
the cost of transport can
remain relatively flat,

29
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,700
whereas the same is not true of the horse.

30
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,260
One disadvantage of bipeds,
as you might have guessed,

31
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,460
is that much more active
control of balance is required.

32
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:06,690
A standing biped is really an inverted
angelum that requires more active control

33
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,580
that a quadruped roll past the runner.

34
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,740
To double my balance a bit
more quasi statics ability

35
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,960
with the polygon of support is
basically impossible to temp of biped

36
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,500
because the best case is polygon
of support is just the line.

37
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,030
We humans often use our arms
inertially to help them balance.

38
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,890
If a mean friend walked up behind you and
gave you a shove, you might use your

39
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,440
arms to transfer your angular momentum and
stay upright or if you're walking

40
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,400
on a tightrope, you might use your arms to
exert counter movements about your torso.

41
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,160
Some bipeds have a purpose built
inertial appendage a tail, but

42
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,770
it's uses are more varied
than you may think.

43
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,230
Here's a video of a hopping
kangaroo where if you look closely,

44
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,230
you'll notice that the tail
seems to rotate opposite

45
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,360
to the direction that that
the leg is rotating in flight.

46
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,120
Why is this?

47
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,890
Here's a cartoon of a kangaroo.

48
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,750
This is from Mark Wayburg's paper.

49
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,340
If you imagine the body in flight as
being kind of a three link system,

50
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,290
with the tail being approximately one
link, the leg being one link, and

51
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,570
the body being the third link.

52
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,959
When the animal is trying to
recirculate its leg forward in flight

53
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,160
moving the tail in the opposite direction
cancels out the moment applied by leg and

54
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,800
keeps the body relatively level but in
the engineering we can both very light and

55
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,220
strong limbs which means that
the inertia of the leg can be small.

56
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,990
Do we still need the tail for this reason?

57
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,350
This is a kangaroo behavior you
might not have seen before.

58
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,300
They use their tail as a fifth leg.

59
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,680
This gate is called a pentopetal crawl,
and

60
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,500
it only happens at the slowest
speeds of movement of a Kangaroo.

61
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,800
But what it's doing is it's trying
to maintain a tripod of support

62
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,350
with every step.

63
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:57,780
Moving on to robotic bipeds, There's
a very crowded space of bipedal robots.

64
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,190
Part of the reason for this is that
there is a push to get human-like robots

65
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,470
out into the world doing
human-like things.

66
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,110
Close to the extreme end,

67
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,160
you'll find this robot, which has close
to 100 actuated degrees of freedom.

68
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:18,050
While this robot is very dexterous and has
a lot of fine manipulation capabilities

69
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,430
all the actuated degrees
of freedom need mass, and

70
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,540
not all of the degrees of freedom
can be useful for every task.

71
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,150
So we're stuck with a relatively low
power density and quasi static motions,

72
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,880
unfortunately.

73
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,010
We'll talk about some ways of
controlling walking in these settings

74
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:35,780
in a couple of slides.

75
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,290
Recently there's only be a push
towards actuated bipeds which have

76
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:44,720
a more reasonable chance of being able
to move dynamically through the world.

77
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,850
ATRIAS is probably the most
well known of this and

78
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,930
it uses a series of elastic
two degree freedom legs.

79
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,730
We asked this question before about by
an animal would like to be a biped versus

80
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:59,710
a quadruped but a lot of those
reasons like manipulation constraints,

81
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,900
etc don't really apply to robots at all.

82
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,100
So what are some reasons that
robots might want to be bipedal?

83
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,000
Gavin talked about scaling in Segment 2.2.

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,790
Here's a quick application of these
techniques to see if it's better to have

85
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,190
a trotting quadruped or a running biped.

86
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,620
Let's assume the amount of motor mass
you're allowed to have in your robot

87
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,040
is fixed.

88
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,310
But this mass can be
divided among end motors.

89
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:27,440
For instance, n would be two for
a trotting quadruped, if it were one for

90
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,900
a running biped.

91
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,850
This reference paper from Sanbay Kim's
group teaches us how the torque and

92
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,100
mass per motor scale with
the gap radius of the motor.

93
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,580
Eliminating our gap, we see that
the torque scale is the reciprocal of n.

94
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,730
What this means is that there is
a technological pressure towards having

95
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:50,620
fewer actuated degrees of freedom
driven by the specific force, scaling,

96
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,520
but the number of motors.

97
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,280
How does biped design affect control?

98
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,040
Before we move to control of
bipeds with low degrees of freedom

99
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,830
I wanted to go quickly over the control
ideas helpful for bipeds with feet, and

100
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,660
typically high degree
of freedom humanoids.

101
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,330
The first idea tries to reuse
the polygon of support idea.

102
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,570
It seems reasonable to try to
reuse the polygon of support idea,

103
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,560
because the foot is
really a small polygon.

104
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,500
The first thought might be to place
the center of mass above the polygon

105
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,420
created by the foot.

106
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,330
A popular generalization
of this is to use the so

107
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:30,030
called zero moment point
instead of the center of mass.

108
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,220
What the zero moment point does is
it incorporates inertial forces

109
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,865
as well as gravitational forces.

110
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:39,800
In this cartoon which
shows the ZMP the center

111
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,300
of mass is adjusted to take into
account horizontal acceleration of

112
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,500
the center of mass of the body
was just denoted by the cart.

113
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,560
Under actuated dynamic bipeds mostly
use a slip like control idea,

114
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,150
like Jeff spoke about it
in the previous segment.

115
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,820
The leg is modelled as a sprung mass.

116
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,940
The balance problem is to keep
the center of mass from toppling.

117
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,290
Raibert's idea was to notice that
there's a special touch toe angle

118
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,610
which causes neutral stance.

119
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,790
Intuitively replacing the toe under
the average position of the body

120
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,780
as it moves through a stance.

121
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,730
In addition to this strategy,

122
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:21,650
slip can actually be stabilized
by a fixed touchdown angle.

123
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,780
This is a controller that requires
no information and no sensing, but

124
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,830
can stabilize slip.

125
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,610
The simply stabilized strategy has,
unfortunately,

126
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,579
a smaller basin of attraction
than the Raibert strategy.

127
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,700
The bipedal we have in our
lab is called the Jerboa.

128
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,130
It's a robot with two legs and
a two degree of freedom actuated tail.

129
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,950
The tail masses only 6% of
the total mass of the body where

130
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,840
you'll see that it's quite effective.

131
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,410
The tail is a five bar linkage
in a spherical configuration.

132
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:58,830
We can see in this video how the two
motors control the two angles of the tail.

133
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,180
This allows the tail to provide horizontal
plain activation to the Jerboa.

134
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,900
Some ways in which a tail actuator is
better for an electro-mechanical robot

135
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,800
is that the tail operation can
happen at a higher duty cycle.

136
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,760
Legs can exert forces on the body
only when it's touching the ground.

137
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,550
Where as the tail can apply force to the
body even when the robot is in the air.

138
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,720
Additionally, the reaction forces from
the tail are independent of the traction

139
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,460
available on the ground.

140
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,180
Compare to the tail, the lengths
of jerboa are relatively simple.

141
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,620
They're only actually begin at the hip.

142
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,290
And the extension degree of
freedom is completely passive.

143
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:39,120
In this image, you will see that
there is a four-bar linkage for

144
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,700
the leg where a spring is controlling
the passive extension degree of freedom.

145
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,830
So now that we've endowed Jerboa
with a relatively complicated and

146
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:53,390
powerful tail,
what are some uses of a robotic tail?

147
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,750
The tail can impart movements
about the vertical axis,

148
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,220
which aids in turning as
you can see in this video.

149
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,858
In the sagittal plane,
the tail can reorient the body pitch.

150
00:09:04,914 --> 00:09:08,420
Again, the tail only has
6% of the body mass.

151
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,850
But you can see that it's very
effective at correcting the body.

152
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,710
In addition to the sagittal reorientation,

153
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,860
we are currently working on
spatial reorientation as well.

154
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,580
Which would be possible because of the two
degree of freedom tail that Jerboa has.

155
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,410
We'll learn a lot more about Jerboa
behaviors in the next segment.

156
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:29,500
To summarize, from biomechanists,
we learned that animals went bipedal for

157
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,170
mostly physiological reasons.

158
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,280
It's interesting that as roboticists,

159
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,070
we learn to put some of the same features
on our robots, but for different reasons.

160
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,870
We should build robots with as few
actuated degrees of freedom as possible

161
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,290
because of specific force and
specific power reasons.

162
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:51,260
Additionally, tails can be helpful for our
bipeds to control the body orientation,

163
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,270
which is often difficult
with underactuated bipeds.
