1
00:00:04,928 --> 00:00:10,048
So what's different in a quadruped from
the sprawled that we just looked at?

2
00:00:10,048 --> 00:00:13,680
As you might have guessed,
quadrupeds are animals that use four legs.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,480
This is distinct from tetrapods.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,670
Tetrapods are evolutionarily
animals with four legs but

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,709
they don't necessarily use them, whereas
quadrupeds move around with four legs.

6
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:25,950
The leg and

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,500
foot structure is much more pronounced in
quadrupeds than sprawled posture runners.

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:37,780
In fact, we see three broad varieties,
unguligrade, digitigrade and plantigrade.

9
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,470
The unguligrades stand on the tips
of their toes, for instance, horses,

10
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,020
cattle, pigs and deer.

11
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,670
Digitigrade animals stand on
their toes for instance, cats,

12
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,630
dogs, dinosaurs, elephants, etc.

13
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,330
And plantigrade animals stand
on their entire foot, for

14
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:57,870
instance, bears, mice, humans, etc.

15
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,524
Additionally, their tendons and muscles
form viscoelastic structures that can be

16
00:01:02,524 --> 00:01:05,418
modeled quite well,
as in this paper from Winters.

17
00:01:07,878 --> 00:01:11,620
Almost all quadrupeds gallop
at their highest speeds.

18
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:16,230
Galloping is a gait which has pronounced
extension of the stride length

19
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,660
which is caused mostly by
an extension of the spine.

20
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,280
Additionally, we start to
see things like tails.

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,330
We'll learn more about tails
in the section on bipeds.

22
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,530
But tails in these quadrupeds also
help turning and reorientation.

23
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,630
We saw that sprawl posture runners almost
exclusively used an alternating tripod,

24
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,270
virtual biped gait.

25
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,020
But gaits in quadrupeds are much
more interesting and varied.

26
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,630
Almost all quadrupeds walk
at their lowest speeds and

27
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,120
almost all of them gallop
at their highest speeds.

28
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,410
But in the middle there's a large
variety of gaits that can be observed.

29
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,400
I want to show you some popular
descriptions of gaits that

30
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,950
appear in biomechanics, so

31
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,440
that you can visually see these diagrams
and understand what is being said.

32
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,750
On the left is the limb support patterns
description that you'll find in some

33
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,650
literature.

34
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:12,290
The field in that represents leg stance
and along the horizontal axis is time.

35
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:19,619
On the right, is the Gait diagram
description where again the field in bars

36
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:25,528
are legs uncontacted to the ground and the
not filled in bars are legs in the air.

37
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:28,245
The Gait diagram description on the right,

38
00:02:28,245 --> 00:02:30,889
gives a much better
idea of the duty cycle,

39
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:35,598
which is exactly how much time the leg
spends on the ground versus in the air.

40
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:37,917
You should be able to look
at these diagrams and

41
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:41,789
have an idea of how the legs come in
contact with the ground for various gaits.

42
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,410
Now that we've seen a few different gaits,
why do they exist?

43
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,740
Why do quadrupeds display different ones?

44
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,570
Why do they just pick the best one and
stick with it?

45
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,980
The primary reason is really energetic.

46
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,590
Energetic efficiency in biomechanics is
often measured by the cost of transport,

47
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,730
which is given by this formula here.

48
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,850
The numerator is the metabolic power
consumed by the animal and at the bottom

49
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:10,200
is some measure of the speed at which the
animal is moving normalized by its mass.

50
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,210
There are mechanical reasons that some
gaits were more energetically efficient.

51
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:17,840
For instance, a spring mass system has
a preferred oscillation frequency,

52
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,790
together with the stride frequency,

53
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:24,720
this might determine which gate is
more preferred at widths speed.

54
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,640
Other things that affect selection
of gaits include, limited speed and

55
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,310
limited force that can
produced by animal legs.

56
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,520
Now that we've seen some
quadrupedal animals,

57
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,830
let's look at some quadrupedal robots.

58
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,600
One of the most famous robotics
companies in the world

59
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,110
is at the erstwhile Boston Dynamics.

60
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,300
And they produced a range of quadrupeds,
from LitttleDog,

61
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:50,560
all the way to the LS3 robot
across a range of size scales.

62
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,000
These robots are hydraulic and
this comes with some of the advantages and

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,880
disadvantages that Gavin
mentioned in his segment.

64
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,860
This is an electromechanical quadruped,
the MIT Cheetah.

65
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,530
It's designed for
having a very transparent drive train and

66
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:10,770
accurate torque control,
which enables simple control strategies.

67
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,376
This robot is called StarlETH.

68
00:04:12,376 --> 00:04:18,056
It's a series elastic
quadruped developed by ETH.

69
00:04:18,056 --> 00:04:22,360
There are many more but we would like to
talk about the robot we have in our lab.

70
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,250
This is Minitaur,
one of our very own quadripeds.

71
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:29,970
It has a very unique leg design which
was designed to optimize a vertical

72
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,760
jumping task and is very good at that.

73
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,650
It's also one of the very few direct
drive legged robots in the world.

74
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,880
Electric motors typically like
operating at very high speeds but

75
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,360
don't give you very high forces
unless you had a gear box.

76
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,260
But careful design choices in a number
of areas has let us make a direct

77
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,300
drive legged robot which has
adequate force capabilities.

78
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,770
You'll see some of its feats of
performance in the last segment.

79
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,810
To go into the details
of mandatory design,

80
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:02,100
let's remember what we've learned about
animal legs in the past few segments.

81
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,910
For running,
legs should be able to store energy.

82
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,438
The legs should be able
to extend actively.

83
00:05:09,338 --> 00:05:13,303
Additionally, there's a lot of evidence
that animals increase their effective leg

84
00:05:13,303 --> 00:05:15,270
stiffness as they run.

85
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:20,050
Here's a plot of human data which
shows an almost linear relationship

86
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,706
between effective leg stiffness and
running speed.

87
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:26,860
Here are some linkage based
two degree freedom leg designs

88
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,410
with two actuators per leg.

89
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,490
Leg extension is an actively controlled
degree of freedom with any of these

90
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,470
designs.

91
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,748
An active compliance or
impedance control is also possible.

92
00:05:37,748 --> 00:05:42,399
These three designs have different
performance with respect to metrics such

93
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,198
as intermittent force Studies D force,
and proprioception.

94
00:05:46,198 --> 00:05:50,378
And you can find out more in this paper we
wrote about direct-drive legged robots.

95
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:57,899
To summarize, Biomechanists tell us
that legs need to swing and retract.

96
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,019
And gaits emerge from energetics and
control needs.

97
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:06,610
We roboticists have learned to build
legs with enough degrees of freedom and

98
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,080
we've learned several control ideas,

99
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,010
some of which we'll talk about
in the last week of the course.

100
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:18,230
Spines and tails haven't become that
popular yet in quadrupedal robots but

101
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,860
it's a burgeoning field and
I'm sure we'll see more of them.
