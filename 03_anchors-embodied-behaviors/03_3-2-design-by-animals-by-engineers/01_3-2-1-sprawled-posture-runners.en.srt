1
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:07,514
In this segment we'll take a look
at some lessons from biology that

2
00:00:07,514 --> 00:00:11,100
have been helpful for
robotics strategic design robots.

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,640
There won't be too much formalism in this
section not least because the design is

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,820
very hard to formalize.

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,180
You should expect this segment
to be at a fairly high level.

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,480
Because we won't have time to delve
too much into details anyways.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,540
Personally, for
me as a roboticist in training,

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,130
going to conferences with biomechanists
has taught me things that I wouldn't have

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,170
learned from engineering courses or
engineering conferences.

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,310
And I hope to share some of that with you.

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,350
The three segments are for three
broad classes of terrestrial runners,

12
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,200
each of which have representative
robots in our lab.

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,120
First step,
we'll look at sprawled posture runners.

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,040
First, what are sprawled posture runners?

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:53,050
As these cartoons are showing you,
sprawled runners have horizontal upper

16
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:58,610
limb segments whereas upright animals
have more vertical upper limb segments.

17
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,935
What this means is that
the center of mass height for

18
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:03,380
sprawled posture runners
is usually much lower.

19
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,990
So h1 is typically much larger
than h2 in the images here.

20
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:13,630
Typical sprawled posture runners
are cockroaches, spiders, crabs, etc.

21
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:18,630
You might wonder why all of these
animals have more legs than dogs, or

22
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,540
horses or upright posture runners.

23
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,930
Alexander gave a very nice argument for
why this might be true.

24
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,730
Let's assume that the center
of mass is at height eight,

25
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:32,355
where we just discussed that
posture runners are usually lower.

26
00:01:32,355 --> 00:01:35,390
So you can calculate
the time that it would take

27
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,450
an animal at height 8
to fall to the ground.

28
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,500
It's a simple application
of first year physics.

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,550
Given a stride frequency f, the reaction
time for the animal to correct for

30
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:52,230
the fall is sigma,
stride periods as given by this equation.

31
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,570
Using some numerical values for

32
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:00,390
a cockroach and a dog hopefully you'll
see what Alexander is getting at.

33
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,490
Assuming Alexander is correct and
the greater number of legs is for

34
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,280
some kind of stability.

35
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,520
Should we assume that cockroaches
always move precise statically?

36
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,010
For one,
cockroaches are tremendously fast.

37
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,940
Cockroaches can run at up to
50 body lengths per second.

38
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,920
A cheetah, for comparison,
runs at 16 body lengths per second.

39
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,640
Cheetahs are known for
being the fastest land animals and

40
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,078
probably what you think of when
you think of a fast animal.

41
00:02:30,078 --> 00:02:36,650
Additionally, some bio-mechanics research,
that's referenced in the side,

42
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,390
shows quite a few things about cockroaches
that you might be surprised by.

43
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,870
They found that static assumptions
are completely insufficient to explain

44
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,460
stability of cockroaches at
their fastest running speeds.

45
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,510
Firstly, the duty factors of
running went down to less than 0.5.

46
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:59,160
The duty factor is what percent of stride
a leg is in contact with the ground.

47
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,850
Cockroaches use a virtual biped gait, and

48
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:06,690
a duty factor of less than 0.5 means that
there must be some amount of time for

49
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,710
which both of its virtual
legs are in the air.

50
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:13,670
The distance from the center of mass
to the edge of the support polygon,

51
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,650
which is the polygon made up of
the three legs on the ground for

52
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,910
a cockroach,
is less than zero at the highest speeds,

53
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:23,290
which means the center of mass is
completely outside its support polygon.

54
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,200
Now that we know that cockroaches
move quite dynamically,

55
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,610
do they actively stabilize
these dynamic gaits?

56
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,900
Spanberg and
Full ran cockroaches over flat ground and

57
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,620
ground with irregular blocks up to three
times the hip height of the cockroach.

58
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,800
This definitely qualifies
as quite rough terrain.

59
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:47,040
And they recorded the muscle potentials
of the cockroaches as it was running at

60
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,160
fairly high speeds over these
different kinds of terrain.

61
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,750
The first surprising finding is that
even over the rough terrain, cockroaches

62
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:00,440
reduced their speed by less than 20% even
as they received large prohibitions.

63
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,470
Secondly, they found that the neurosignals
going to the muscles of the cockroach

64
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,860
didn't vary much at all between the rough
terrain and the very flat terrain.

65
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,820
What this means is that the descending
control signals that the cockroach muscles

66
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,630
receive aren't really varying that
much when the type of terrain changes.

67
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:22,250
The susceptibility of the cockroach
must be explained by mechanical feedback

68
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,080
that's set by feet forward activation.

69
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,803
The next question you might be wondering
about are why cockroach legs are splayed

70
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,688
as they are shown in this image.

71
00:04:33,753 --> 00:04:38,510
The legs in insects are typically either
levers or they're inclined struts.

72
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,200
The front legs act more as levers,

73
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,530
which means that they experience
large tangential moments.

74
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,920
Whereas the rear legs are usually struts,

75
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,090
which means they act more
just in axial directions.

76
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,710
The ground reaction force patterns of
cockroaches as they run over force plates

77
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,470
shows that there are large
horizontal forces,

78
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,990
even if they're running
at a constant speed.

79
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,700
What does this mean?

80
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,490
Are the cockroaches needlessly
slowing themselves down and

81
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,910
accelerating themselves every stride?

82
00:05:08,988 --> 00:05:12,511
Did this analysis and showed that
the horizontal forces actually have

83
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:16,760
a significant effect in terms of
the movements around the joints.

84
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,120
As you can see, the rear legs
contact the ground at a point not

85
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,130
directly vertically below
where the rear hips are.

86
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,837
And so directing the ground reaction force
to a point closer to the hips minimizes

87
00:05:28,837 --> 00:05:30,320
the movement about the joints.

88
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,170
In summary, we have learned a little bit
that cockroaches don't use their brains

89
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:39,330
for much, but have bodies very
finely tuned for how they move.

90
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,290
In fact, how they move almost defines how
cockroaches are built and how they look.

91
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:47,540
We have not even gotten into
microstructures, construction materials,

92
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,010
etc., but the common theme is that

93
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,490
locomotion is a big factor in
how cockroaches are designed.

94
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,500
And this is true for animals in general.

95
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,620
Now let's look at some artificial or
man-made sprawled posture runners.

96
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,240
If we sample the hexipedal
robots in the world,

97
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,410
we'll find a ton that look like this.

98
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,650
They have fully articulated joints and
lots of degrees of freedom.

99
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,070
With so many actuated joints,

100
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,010
unfortunately, they'll have to
rely on quasistatic stability.

101
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,870
However, we learned before that
cockroaches move in a very dynamic way,

102
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,710
and they use mechanical
passive stabilization.

103
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,493
There are some robots that attempt to
embody these biomechanical principles,

104
00:06:24,493 --> 00:06:25,965
the first among which is RHex.

105
00:06:28,787 --> 00:06:31,433
Which of these do you think
looks more like the cockroach?

106
00:06:34,254 --> 00:06:37,507
So what does it mean to have
mechanical passive stabilization in

107
00:06:37,507 --> 00:06:39,280
terms of engineering?

108
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,500
Specifically, what
are the implications on design?

109
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,650
As Jeff described in week two, walking
is an exchange of kinetic energy and

110
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,580
gravitational potential energy.

111
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,304
So they typically isolate out of phase.

112
00:06:51,304 --> 00:06:53,425
Where as running, hopping and

113
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:57,920
trotting display an inface kinetic and
potential energy oscillation.

114
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,790
So what does this mean?

115
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:03,580
Where is the energy going in
the values of potential and

116
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,170
kinetic energy, when animals are running?

117
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:10,310
The answer is that the energy is
stored in elastic potential energy.

118
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:14,340
So for running, you really need
compliance either physical or virtual.

119
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:20,280
Not just that, Blickhan showed that
the leg force versus extension,

120
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,070
the effective stiffness of the leg,
is also roughly mass independent for

121
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,080
a very large range of animals.

122
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,100
So the relative stiffness per leg is
conserve and different gates use different

123
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,510
numbers of legs which determine
the overall system stiffness.

124
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,550
These lessons tell us
a lot about the virtual or

125
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,640
physical compliance that is expected to be
required when you're designing your robot.

126
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,690
So how was this implemented on RHex?

127
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:49,150
One of the first things you'll
probably notice about RHex is the C

128
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:54,280
shaped leg design, which is on more
modern iterations of this robot.

129
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,540
The benefits of this C
shaped leg are numerous.

130
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:01,770
The first is that it provides an easy
way to add compliance to the system,

131
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,530
without having too many moving parts.

132
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,960
In fact,
the whole leg is one mechanical part.

133
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,070
But it gives us compliance.

134
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,850
It's relatively easy to manufacture.

135
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,400
It gives us rolling contact,

136
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:19,570
which makes our leg look more
like a wheel in some situations.

137
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:24,040
The C shape also provides an effectively
increasing mechanical advantage.

138
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,300
Effective Mechanical Advantage or

139
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,900
EMA is something Gavin talked
about in the previous segment.

140
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:33,460
And you can think about how this would
be useful for RHex to be leaping.

141
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,390
There's a lot more on the conceptual
development of RHex coming up in

142
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,340
the next segment, so
I will not spend too much time on it now.

143
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:40,960
Here's a question,

144
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,610
should all of the legs of your
hexapedal robot have the same design?

145
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:49,600
The robot that you see running around in
this video quite fast, is called iSprawl.

146
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,290
iSprawl was designed at Stanford,
and it's a .3 kg, but

147
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:57,650
15 body lengths per second
open loop controlled robot.

148
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:03,538
This robot has explicit differentiation
between its front and rear legs.

149
00:09:03,538 --> 00:09:06,160
So the rear legs tend
to accelerate the robot

150
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,490
where as the front legs tend to brake and
stabilize.

151
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:15,360
The actuator degrees of freedom on this
robot are radio histen leg motions

152
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,480
whereas there is significant
passive rotational stiffness.

153
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,080
So to summarize, biomechanics
tells us that sprawled animals

154
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,450
might need more legs because of
quasi static stability reasons.

155
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,660
But at the same time, they're not limited
to this, and they run quite dynamically.

156
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,500
They don't use active
control of their degrees of

157
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,500
freedom much when running
at the highest speeds.

158
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,620
From these lessons,

159
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,780
roboticists learn that dynamic
locomotion offers lots of advantages.

160
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,310
For instance,

161
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,800
you don't have to carefully plan your
footsteps because the mechanical self

162
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,210
stabilization should play a large part in
preventing the robot from falling over.

163
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,360
It's important to think of
energy exchange to run,

164
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,110
which means that you might often have
to think about things like compliance.

165
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:01,460
So now that we've learned these lessons,
do robots really needs six legs?

166
