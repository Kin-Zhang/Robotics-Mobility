2
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:24,988
Welcome to week three
of our robotics MOOC.

3
00:00:24,988 --> 00:00:30,629
In this week, we'll be thinking about
taking those primitives of week two and

4
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:34,389
putting together,
attaching limbs to bodies, and

5
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:36,790
getting them to start to behave.

6
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,145
The first half hour of this week
concerns itself with what limbs can do,

7
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:48,998
what they can't do, and
how to think about their capabilities,

8
00:00:48,998 --> 00:00:52,728
first of all in motion,
and second of all at work.

9
00:00:52,728 --> 00:00:54,388
What do I mean by that?

10
00:00:54,388 --> 00:01:00,430
In 3.1.1, we'll review kinematics,
which is the study of limbs in motion.

11
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:04,440
What are the mobility properties of
the limbs without thinking about

12
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,340
how they achieve those motions in time?

13
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,500
Then in the second segment
of this half hour,

14
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,480
we'll review the way in
which Newton's laws,

15
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:24,870
when they attach to the masses that are
constrained by these complicated linkages,

16
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:30,620
how those laws create very complicated and
interesting dynamical effects

17
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,060
such as I talked about in the original
discussion of animal mobility.

18
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:42,230
It will turn out that when animals run,
they turn themselves into pogo sticks.

19
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:46,320
Remember that slip template from week two?

20
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,000
You're going to see it here in many,
many different incarnations.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,800
In bipeds, in quadrupeds, in six legged
runners, in many legged runners.

22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,360
You're going to see how the kinematics
of these linkages get transformed into

23
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,420
pogo sticks by the animal coordination
that we try to be inspired about and

24
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,600
build into our robots.

25
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:14,970
Here is an example of a machine that
doesn't look like the pogo stick, but

26
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,150
it's built to run as
a composition of pogo sticks and

27
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,080
leap like a coordinated single pogo stick.

28
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,280
Stay tuned.

29
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,410
We won't talk about this composition yet.

30
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,800
That's for week four, but
that's where we're headed.

31
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,810
The second half hour of this week will
be concerned with designs of bodies.

32
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:40,700
How do we attach these wonderful limbs to
bodies to get complicated robots that can

33
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,300
do interesting tasks for us?

34
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,800
We'll start with sprawled posture runners.

35
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,380
Very strongly informed by what
our friends in biomechanics and

36
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,070
integrated biology can tell us
about how the arthropods do it.

37
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,160
Well, many, many, many engineers and
even hobbyist have been inspired

38
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,150
by the sprawled posture of arthropods,
which are the most successful

39
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,660
animals on the planet if you consider
their weight and biomass, but

40
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,865
we'll be focusing on a machine that
doesn't look anything like a cockroach yet

41
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:23,015
is bio-inspired and
borrows the principals of the cockroach so

42
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:28,800
that when it starts running,
it is able to traverse these very,

43
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,990
very broken and unstable landscapes.

44
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,508
The first time that that had been
achieved by any legged machine.

45
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:42,192
We'll move from hexopods to quadrupeds,

46
00:03:42,192 --> 00:03:46,250
four-legged machines, and we'll spend
some time talking about the marvelous

47
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,944
quadrupeds that have been pioneered by
our friends at Boston Dynamics founded by

48
00:03:50,944 --> 00:03:55,550
Marc Raibert, the very person who taught
us about pogo sticking the robots.

49
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,530
We'll spend some time
talking about how Marc and

50
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,959
his engineers have built those
pogo sticks into these quadrupeds.

51
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:09,240
Finally, we'll introduce bipeds,
and we'll distinguish

52
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,250
between bipeds that have many, many,
many, many degrees of actuated freedom

53
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,570
such as this anthropomorphic
design to the left and

54
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:24,960
those machines that are much, much more
inspired by the mechanics of running such

55
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,420
as the ATRIAS machine built by Professor
Hurst at Oregon State University.

56
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:33,680
We will spend a fair bit of
time thinking about how to

57
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,710
take those principles and extract them
away from either the anthropomorphic or

58
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:43,690
the mere pogo sticking designs into
designs of bodies that are much,

59
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:48,870
much more versatile but still embody
these pogo sticking dynamical principles.

60
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,908
Here's a leaping machine built by Ms.

61
00:04:53,908 --> 00:05:00,280
Anna Brill with Avik De, in our
GRASP Laboratory over the last year,

62
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,270
showing how to get leaping behaviors
out of a tailed biped that is

63
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,120
called the Jerboa, about which
you'll hear much more in week four.

64
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,840
Welcome to week three.

65
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,999
We're going to spend the week
putting the bodies together and

66
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:19,658
thinking about how what we learned
about dynamics and controls and

67
00:05:19,658 --> 00:05:23,668
kinematics can begin to inform
our design of behaviors.
